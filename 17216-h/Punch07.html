<h4>INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE APPLEBITE FAMILY AND TO AGAMEMNON
COLLUMPSION APPLEBITE IN PARTICULAR.</h4>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he following is extracted from the
<em>Parliamentary Guide</em> for 18&mdash;:&mdash;&ldquo;APPLEBITE, ISAAC
(<em>Puddingbury</em>). Born March 25, 1780; descended from his
grandfather, and has issue.&rdquo; And upon reference to a monument in
Puddingbury church, representing the first Mrs. Applebite (who was a
housemaid) industriously scrubbing a large tea-urn, whilst another figure
(supposed to be the second Mrs. Applebite) is pointing reproachfully to a
little fat cherub who is blowing himself into a fit of apoplexy from some
unassignable cause or another&mdash;I say upon reference to this monument,
upon which is blazoned forth all the stock virtues of those who employ
stonemasons, I find, that in July, 18&mdash;, the said Isaac was gathered
unto Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, leaving behind him&mdash;a seat in the House
of Commons&mdash;a relict&mdash;the issue aforesaid, and &pound;50,000 in
the three per cents.</p>
<p>The widow Applebite had so arranged matters with her husband, that
two-thirds of the above sum were left wholly and solely to her, as some
sort of consolation under her bereavement of the &ldquo;best of husbands
and the kindest of fathers.&rdquo; (<em>Vide</em> monument.) Old Isaac
must have been a treasure, for his wife either missed him so much, or felt
so desirous to learn if there was another man in the world like him, that,
as soon as the monument was completed and placed in Puddingbury chancel,
she married a young officer in a dashing dragoon regiment, and started to
the Continent to spend the honeymoon, leaving her son&mdash;</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON COLLUMPSION APPLEBITE (the apoplectic &ldquo;cherub&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;issue&rdquo; alluded to in the <em>Parliamentary
Guide</em>), to the care of himself.</p>
<p>A.C.A. was the pattern of what a young man ought to be. He had 16,000
and odd pounds in the three per cents., hair that curled naturally, stood
five feet nine inches without his shoes, always gave a shilling to a
waiter, lived in a terrace, never stopped out all night (but once), and
paid regularly every Monday morning. Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite was a
happy bachelor! The women were delighted to see him, and the men to dine
with him: to the one he gave <em>bouquets</em>; to the other, cigars: in
short, everybody considered A.C.A. as A1; and A.C.A. considered that A1
was his proper mark.</p>
<p>It is somewhat singular, but no man knows when he <em>is</em> really
happy: he may fancy that he wants for nothing, and may even persuade
himself that addition or subtraction would be certain to interfere with
the perfectitude of his enjoyment. He deceives himself. If he wishes to
assure himself of the exact state of his feelings, let him ask his
friends; they are disinterested parties, and will find out some annoyance
that has escaped his notice. It was thus with Agamemnon Collumpsion
Applebite. He had made up his mind that he wanted for nothing, when it was
suddenly found out by his friends that he was in a state of felicitous
destitution. It was discovered simultaneously, by five mamas and eighteen
daughters, that Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite <em>must</em> want a wife;
and that his sixteen thousand and odd pounds must be a source of
<em>undivided</em> anxiety to him. Stimulated by the most praiseworthy
considerations, a solemn compact was entered into by the aforesaid five
mamas, on behalf of the aforesaid eighteen daughters, by which they were
pledged to use every means to convince Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite of
his deplorable condition; but no unfair advantage was to be taken to
ensure a preference for any particular one of the said eighteen daughters,
but that the said Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite should be left free to
exercise his own discretion, so far as the said eighteen daughters were
concerned, but should any other daughter, of whatever mama soever,
indicate a wish to become a competitor, she was to be considered a common
enemy, and scandalized accordingly.</p>
<p>Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite, about ten o&rsquo;clock on the
following evening, was seated on a sofa, between Mrs. Greatgirdle and Mrs.
Waddledot (the two mamas deputed to open the campaign), each with a cup of
very prime Mocha coffee, and a massive fiddle-pattern tea-spoon. On the
opposite side of the room, in a corner, was a very large cage, in the sole
occupancy of a solitary Java sparrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor bird looks very miserable,&rdquo; sighed Mrs.
Greatgirdle, (the hostess upon this occasion.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very miserable!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Waddledot; and the truth of
the remark was apparent to every one.</p>
<p>The Java sparrow was moulting and suffering from a cutaneous disorder
at the same time; so what with the falling off, and scratching off of his
feathers, he looked in a most deplorable condition; which was rendered
more apparent by the magnitude of his cage. He seemed like the
<em>last</em> debtor confined in the Queen&rsquo;s Bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never been himself since the death of his mate.&rdquo;
(Here the bird scarified himself with great violence.) &ldquo;He is so
restless; and though he eats very well, and hops about, he seems to have
lost all care of his person, as though he would put on mourning if he had
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no possibility of dyeing his feathers?&rdquo; remarked
Agamemnon Collumpsion, feeling the necessity of saying something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the inky cloak, Mr. Applebite,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Greatgirdle, &ldquo;that truly indicates regret; but it&rsquo;s
here,&rdquo; (laying her hand upon her left side): &ldquo;no&mdash;there,
under his liver wing, that he feels it, poor bird! It&rsquo;s a shocking
thing to live alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And especially in such a large cage,&rdquo; said Mrs. Waddledot.
&ldquo;<em>Your house</em> is rather large, Mr. Applebite?&rdquo; inquired
Mrs. Greatgirdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Collumpsion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you very lonely?&rdquo; said Mrs. Waddledot and Mrs.
Greatgirdle both in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very lively, you were going to say,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs.
G.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. G. was wrong in her conjecture of Collumpsion&rsquo;s reply.
He was about to say, &ldquo;Why, not at all;&rdquo; but she, of course,
knew best what he ought to have answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often feel for you, Mr. Applebite,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Waddledot; &ldquo;and think how strange it is that you, who really are a
nice young man&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t say so to flatter you&mdash;that
you should have been so unsuccessful with the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collumpsion&rsquo;s vanity was awfully mortified at this idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. G &ldquo;I wonder
it don&rsquo;t make you miserable. There is no home, I mean the
&lsquo;<em>Sweet, sweet</em> home,&rsquo; without a wife. Try, try again,
Mr. Applebite,&rdquo; (tapping his arm as she rose;) &ldquo;faint heart
never won fair lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refused Mr. Waddledot three times, but I yielded at last; take
courage from that, and 24, Pleasant Terrace, may shortly become that
Elysium&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. W., as she
rolled gracefully to a card-table; and accidentally, <em>of course</em>,
cut the ace of spades, which she exhibited to Collumpsion with a very
mysterious shake of the head.</p>
<p>Agamemnon returned to 24, Pleasant Terrace, a discontented man. He felt
that there was no one sitting up for him&mdash;nothing but a
rush-light&mdash;the dog might bark as he entered, but no voice was there
to welcome him, and with a heavy heart he ascended the two stone steps of
his dwelling.</p>
<p>He took out his latch-key, and was about to unlock the door, when a
loud knocking was heard in the next street. Collumpsion paused, and then
gave utterance to his feelings. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s music&mdash;positively
music. This is my house&mdash;there&rsquo;s my name on the
brass-plate&mdash;that&rsquo;s my knocker, as I can prove by the bill and
receipt; and, yet, here I am about to sneak in like a burglar. Old John
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to bed another night; I&rsquo;ll not indulge the
lazy scoundrel any longer, Yet the poor old fellow nursed me when a child.
I&rsquo;ll compromise the matter&mdash;I&rsquo;ll knock, and let myself
in.&rdquo; So saying, Collumpsion thumped away at the door, looked around
to see that he was unobserved, applied his latch-key, and slipped into his
house just as old John, in a state of great alarm and undress, was
descending the stairs with a candle and a boot-jack.</p>

<h3>AN ACUTE ANGLE.</h3>
<p>We read in the <em>Glasgow Courier</em> of an enormous salmon hooked at
Govan, which measured three feet, three inches in length. The <em>Morning
Herald</em> mentions several gudgeons of twice the size, caught, we
understand, by Alderman Humphery, and conveyed to Town per Blackwall
Railway.</p>

<h2>IMPORTANT NEWS FROM CHINA.</h2>
<h3>ARRIVAL OF THE OVERLAND MAIL!</h3>
<p class="rgt"><em>August 28, 1841.</em></p>
<p>We have received expresses from the Celestial Empire by our own private
electro-galvanic communication. As this rapid means of transmission
carries dispatches so fast that we generally get them even before they are
written, we are enabled to be considerably in advance of the common daily
journals; more especially as we have obtained news up to the end of next
week.</p>
<p>The most important paper which has come to hand is the <em>Macao Sunday
Times</em>. It appears that the fortifications for surrounding Pekin are
progressing rapidly, but that the government have determined upon building
the ramparts of japanned canvas and bamboo rods, instead of pounded rice,
which was thought almost too fragile to resist the attacks of the English
barbarians. Some handsome guns, of blue and white porcelain, have been
placed on the walls, with a proportionate number of carved ivory balls,
elaborately cut one inside the other. These, it is presumed, will split
upon firing, and produce incalculable mischief and confusion. Within the
gates a frightful magazine of gilt crackers, and other fireworks, has been
erected; which, in the event of the savages penetrating the
fortifications, will be exploded one after another, to terrify them into
fits, when they will be easily captured. This precaution has been scarcely
thought necessary by some of the mandarins, as our great artist, Wang, has
covered the external joss-house with frantic figures that, must strike
terror to every barbarian. Gold paper has also been kept constantly
burning, on altars of holy clay, at every practicable point of the
defences, which it is hardly thought they will have the hardihood to
approach, and the sacred ducks of Fanqui have been turned loose in the
river to retard the progress of the infidel fleet.</p>
<p>During the storm of last week the portcullis, which hail been placed in
the northern gate, and was composed of solid rice paper, with cross-bars
of chop-sticks, was much damaged. It is now under repair, and will be
coated entirely with tea-chest lead, to render it perfectly impregnable.
The whole of the household troops and body-guard of the emperor have also
received new accoutrements of tin-foil and painted isinglass. They have
likewise been armed with varnished bladders, containing peas and date
stones, which produce a terrific sound upon the least motion.</p>
<p>An Englishman has been gallantly captured this morning, in a small
boat, by one of our armed junks. He will eat his eyes in the Palace-court
this afternoon; and then, being enclosed in soft porcelain, will be baked
to form a statue for the new pagoda at Bo-Lung, the first stone of which
was laid by the late emperor, to celebrate his victory over the rude
northern islanders.</p>
<p class="rgt"><em>Canton</em>.</p>
<p>The last order of the government, prohibiting the exportation of tea
and rhubarb, has been issued by the advice of Lin, who translates the
English newspapers to the council. It is affirmed in these journals, that
millions of these desert tribes have no other beverage than tea for their
support. As their oath prohibits any other liquor, they will be driven to
water for subsistence, and, unable to correct its unhealthy influence by
doses of rhubarb, will die miserably. In anticipation of this event, large
catacombs are being erected near their great city, on the authority of
Slo-Lefe-Tee, who visited it last year, and intends shortly to go there
again. The rhubarb prohibition will, it is said, have a great effect upon
the English market for plums, pickled salmon, and greengages; and the
physicians, or disciples of the great Hum, appear uncertain as to the
course to be pursued.</p>
<p>The emperor has issued a chop to the Hong merchants, forbidding them to
assist or correspond with the invaders, under pain of having their
finger-nails drawn out and rings put in their noses. Howqua resists the
order, and it is the intention of Lin, should he remain obstinate, to
recommend his being pounded up with broken crockery and packed in Chinese
catty packages, to be forwarded, as an example, to the Mandarin Pidding,
of the wild island.</p>
<p>An English flag, stolen by a deserter from Chusan, will be formally
insulted to-morrow in the market-place, by the emperor and his court. Dust
will be thrown at it, accompanied by derisive grimaces, and it will be
subsequently hoisted, in scorn, to blow, at the mercy of the winds, upon
the summit of the palace, within sight of the barbarians.</p>
<h4>LEVANT MAIL.</h4>
<h5>CONSTANTINOPLE, ALEXANDRIA, AND SMYRNA.</h5>
<p class="rgt"><em>August 30.</em></p>
<p>The Sultan got very fuddled last night, with forbidden juice, in the
harem, and tumbled down the ivory steps leading from the apartment of the
favourite, by which accident he seriously cut his nose. Every guard is to
be bastinadoed in consequence, and the wine-merchant will be privately
sewn up in a canvas-bag and thrown into the Bosphorus this evening.</p>
<p>A relation of Selim Pacha, despatched by the Sultan to collect taxes in
Beyrout, was despatched by the Syrians a few hours after his arrival.</p>
<p>The periodical conflagration of the houses, mosques, and synagogues, in
Smyrna, took place with great splendour on the 30th ult., and the next
will be arranged for the ensuing month, when everybody suspected of the
plague will receive orders from the government to remain in their
dwellings until they are entirely consumed. By this salutary arrangement,
it is expected that much improvement will take place in the public
health.</p>
<p>The inundation of the Nile has also been very favourable this year, The
water has risen higher than usual, and carried off several hundred poor
people. The Board of Guardians of the Alexandria Union are consequently
much rejoiced.</p>

rural pasturages at Smithfield. Some of the <em>heads</em> of the party

<h3>ADVICE GRATIS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What will you take?&rdquo; said Peel to Russell, on adjourning
from the School of Design. &ldquo;Anything you recommend.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then let it be your departure,&rdquo; was the significant
rejoinder.</p>

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<p>Having advised you in our last paper of &ldquo;Dress in general,&rdquo;
we now proceed to the important consideration of</p>
<h3>DRESS IN PARTICULAR,</h3>
<p>a subject of such paramount interest and magnitude, that we feel an
Encyclop&aelig;dia would be barely sufficient for its full developement;
and it is our honest conviction that, until professorships of this truly
noble art are instituted at the different universities, the same
barbarisms of style will be displayed even by those of gentle blood, as
now too frequently detract from the Augustan character of the age.</p>
<p>To take as comprehensive a view of this subject as our space will
admit, we have divided it into the quality, the cut, the ornaments, and
the pathology.</p>
<h4>THE QUALITY</h4>
<p>comprises <em>the texture, colour, and age of the materials</em>.</p>
<p>Of the texture there are only two kinds compatible with the reputation
of a gentleman&mdash;the very fine and the very coarse; or, to speak
figuratively&mdash;the Cachmere and the Witney blanket.</p>
<p>The latter is an emanation from the refinement of the nineteenth
century, for a prejudice in favour of &ldquo;extra-superfine&rdquo;
formerly existed, as the coarser textures, now prevalent, were confined
exclusively to common sailors, hackney-coachmen, and bum-bailiffs. These
frivolous distinctions are happily exploded, and the true gentleman may
now show in Saxony, or figure in Flushing&mdash;the one being suggestive
of his property, and the other indicative of his taste. These remarks
apply exclusively to woollens, whether for coats or trousers.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on every gentleman to have a perfect library of
waistcoats, the selection of which must be regulated by the cost of the
material, as it would be derogatory, in the highest degree, to a man
aspiring to the character of a <em>distingu&eacute;</em>, to decorate his
bosom with a garment that would by any possibility come under the
denomination of &ldquo;these choice patterns, only 7<em>s.</em>
6<em>d.</em>&rdquo; There are certain designs for this important
decorative adjunct, which entirely preclude them from the wardrobes of the
&eacute;lite&mdash;the imaginative bouquets upon red-plush grounds,
patronised by the ingenious constructors of canals and
rail-roads&mdash;the broad and brilliant Spanish striped Valencias, which
distinguish the <em>savans</em> or knowing ones of the stable&mdash;the
cotton (must we profane the word!) velvet impositions covered with
botanical diagrams done in distemper, and monopolized by lawyers&rsquo;
clerks and small professionals&mdash;the <em>positive</em> or genuine
Genoa velvet, with violent and showy embellishments of roses, dahlias, and
peonies, which find favour in the eyes of aldermen, attorneys, and the
proprietors of four-wheel chaises, are all to be avoided as the fifth
daughter of a clergyman&rsquo;s widow.</p>
<p>It is almost superfluous to add, that breeches can only be made of
white leather or white kerseymere, for any other colour or material would
awaken associations of the dancing-master, the waiter, the butler, or the
bumpkin, or, what is equally to be dreaded, &ldquo;the highly
respectables&rdquo; of the last century.</p>
<p>The dressing-gown is a portion of the costume which commands particular
attention; for though no man &ldquo;can appear as a hero to his
valet,&rdquo; he must keep up the gentleman. This can only be done by the
dressing-gown. To gentlemen who occupy apartments, the <em>robe de
chambre</em>, if properly selected, is of infinite advantage; for an
Indian shawl or rich brocaded silk (of which this garment should only be
constructed), will be found to possess extraordinary pacific properties
with the landlady, when the irregularity of your remittances may have
ruffled the equanimity of her temper, whilst you are</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/007-03.png"><img src=
"images/007-03.png" alt="A man lays under a running spigot." id=
"img007-03" name="img007-03" width="50%" /></a>
<p>INCLINED TO TAKE IT COOLLY;</p>
</div>
<p>whereas a gray Duffield, or a cotton chintz, would be certain to induce
deductions highly prejudicial to the respectability of your character, or,
what is of equal importance, to the duration of your credit.</p>
<p>The colour of your materials should be selected with due regard to the
species of garment and the tone of the complexion. If the face be of that
faint drab which your friends would designate <em>pallid</em>, and your
enemies sallow, a coat of pea-green or snuff-brown must be scrupulously
eschewed, whilst black or invisible green would, by contrast, make that
appear delicate and interesting, which, by the use of the former colours,
must necessarily seem bilious and brassy.</p>
<p>The rosy complexionist must as earnestly avoid all sombre tints, as the
inelegance of a healthful appearance should never be obtrusively displayed
by being placed in juxta-position with colours diametrically opposite,
though it is almost unnecessary to state that any one ignorant enough to
appear of an evening in a coat of any other colour than blue or black
(regimentals, of course, excepted), would certainly be condemned to a
quarantine in the servant&rsquo;s hall. There are colours which, if worn
for trousers by the first peer of the realm, would be as condemnatory of
his character as a gentleman, as levanting on the settling-day for the
Derby.</p>
<p>The dark drab, which harmonises with the mud&mdash;the peculiar
pepper-and-salt which is warranted not to grow gray with age&mdash;the
indescribable mixtures, which have evidently been compounded for the sake
of economy, must ever be exiled from the wardrobe and legs of a
gentleman.</p>
<p>The hunting-coat must be invariably of scarlet, due care being taken
before wearing to dip the tips of the tails in claret or port wine, which,
for new coats, or for those of gentlemen who do <em>not</em> hunt, has
been found to give them an equally veteran appearance with the sweat of
the horse.</p>
<p><em>Of the age</em> it is only necessary to state, that a truly
fashionable suit should never appear under a week, or be worn longer than
a month from the time that it left the hands of its parent schneider.
Shooting-coats are exceptions to the latter part of this rule, as a
garment devoted to the field should always bear evidence of long service,
and a new jacket should be consigned to your valet, who, if he understands
his profession, will carefully rub the shoulders with a hearth-stone and
bole-ammonia, to convey the appearance of friction and the deposite of the
rust of the gun<sup>1</sup>.<span class="sidenote">1. Gentlemen who are
theoretical, rather than practical sportsmen, would find it beneficial to
have a partridge carefully plucked, and the feathers sparingly deposited
in the pockets of the shooting-jacket usually applied to the purposes of
carrying game. Newgate Market possesses all the advantages of a preserved
manor.</span></p>
<p>Of the cut, ornaments, and pathology of dress, we shall speak next
week, for these are equally essential to ensure</p>

<p>AN INTRODUCTION TO FASHIONABLE SOCIETY.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>BEGINNING EARLY.</h3>
<p>We are informed by the <em>Times</em> of Saturday, that at the late
Conservative enactment at D.L., not only his Royal Highness Prince Albert,
but the <em>infant</em> Princess Royal, was &ldquo;drunk, with the usual
honours.&rdquo;&mdash;[<em>Proh pudor!</em>&mdash;PUNCH.]</p>
<hr />
<h3>SIBTHORP&rsquo;S VERY BEST.</h3>
<p>Sibthorp, meeting Peel in the House of Commons, after congratulating
him on his present enviable position, finished the confab with the
following unrivalled conundrum:&mdash;&ldquo;By the bye, which of your
vegetables does your Tamworth speech
resemble!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Spinach,&rdquo; replied Peel, who, no doubt,
associated it with <em>gammon</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; said the
gallant Colonel, &ldquo;your rope inions (<em>your opinions</em>), to be
sure!&rdquo; Peel opened his mouth, and never closed it till he took his
seat at the table.</p>
<hr />
<h3>BEAUTIFUL COINCIDENCE!&mdash;A PAIR OF TOOLS.</h3>
<p>Sir Francis Burdett, the superannuated Tory <em>tool</em>, proposed the
Conservative healths; and <em>Toole</em> the second, as toast-master,
announced them to the assemblage.</p>

<h2>THE CURRAH CUT;</h2>
<h3>OR, HOW WE ALL GOT A FI&rsquo;PENNY BIT A-PIECE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Are the two ponies ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve, all five of you, got your fi&rsquo;pennies for
Tony Dolan, the barber, at Kells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be off; there&rsquo;s good boys! Ride and tie like
Christians, and don&rsquo;t be going double on the brute beasts; for a bit
of a walk now and then will just stretch your legs. Be back at five to
dinner; and let us see what bucks you&rsquo;ll look with your new-trimmed
curls. Stay, there&rsquo;s another fi&rsquo;penny; spend that among you,
and take care of yourselves, my little jewels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the parting queries and instructions of my kind old uncle to
five as roaring, mischievous urchins as ever stole whisky to soak the
shamrock on St. Patrick&rsquo;s day. The chief director, schemer, and
perpetrator of all our fun and devilry, was, strange to say, &ldquo;my
cousin Bob:&rdquo; the smallest, and, with one exception, the youngest of
the party. But Bob was his grandmother&rsquo;s &ldquo;ashey
pet&rdquo;&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;jewel&rdquo;&mdash;his
father&rsquo;s &ldquo;mannikin&rdquo;&mdash;his nurse&rsquo;s
&ldquo;honey&rdquo;&mdash;and the whole world&rsquo;s &ldquo;darlin&rsquo;
little devil of a rogue!&rdquo; The expression of a face naturally arch,
beaming with good humour, and radiant with happy laughter, was singularly
heightened by a strange peculiarity of vision, which I am at a loss to
describe. It was, if the reader can idealise the thing, an absolute
&ldquo;beauty,&rdquo; which, unfortunately, can only be written about by
the appliances of some term conveying the notion of a blemish. The glances
from his bright eyes seemed to steal out from under their long fringe, the
most reckless truants of exulting mirth. No matter what he said, he looked
a joke. Now for his orders:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aisy with you, lads. Cousin Harry, take first ride on St.
Patrick (the name of the ass)&mdash;here&rsquo;s a leg up. The two Dicks
can have Scrub and Rasper. Jack and Billy, boys, catch a hold of the
bridles, or devil a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;worth of ride and tie there&rsquo;ll
be in at all, if them Dicks get the start&mdash;Shanks&rsquo; mare will
take you to Kells. Don&rsquo;t be galloping off in that manner, but shoot
aisy! Remember, the ass has got to keep up with you, and I&rsquo;ve got to
keep up with the ass. That&rsquo;s the thing&mdash;steady she goes!
It&rsquo;s an elegant day, and no hurry in life. Spider! come here,
boy&mdash;that&rsquo;s right. Down, sir! down, you devil, or wipe your
paws. Bad manners to you&mdash;look at them breeches! Never mind,
there&rsquo;s a power of rats at Tony Carroll&rsquo;s
barn&mdash;it&rsquo;s mighty little out o&rsquo; the way, and may be
we&rsquo;ll get a hunt. What say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hunt, a hunt, by all manes! there&rsquo;s the fun of it! Come
on, lads&mdash;here&rsquo;s the place!&mdash;turn off, and go to work!
Wait, wait! get a stick a-piece, and break the necks of &rsquo;em!
Hurrah!&mdash;in Spider!&mdash;find &rsquo;em boy! Good lad! Tare an ouns,
you may well squeak! Good dog! good dog! that&rsquo;s a
grandfather!&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have more yet; the family always come to
the ould one&rsquo;s berrin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em often, and
mighty dacent they behave. Damn Kells and the barber, up with the boords
and go to work!&mdash;this is something like sport! Houly Paul,
there&rsquo;s one up my breeches&mdash;here&rsquo;s the tail of
him&mdash;he caught a hould of my leather-garter. Come out of that,
Spider! Spider, here he is&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;give him another
shake for his impudence&mdash;serve him out! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast and furious&rdquo; grew our incessant urging on of the
willing Spider, for his continued efforts at extermination. At the end of
two hours, the metamorphosed barn was nearly stripped of its
flooring&mdash;nine huge rats lay dead, as trophies of our own
achievements&mdash;the panting Spider, &ldquo;by turns caressing, and by
turns caressed,&rdquo; licking alternately the hands and faces of all, as
we sat on the low ledge of the doorway, wagging his close-cut stump of
tail, as if he were resolved, by his unceasing exertions, to get entirely
rid of that excited dorsal ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the rael thing,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, devil a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of Kells or hair-cutting
there&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a taste,&rdquo; chimed in Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it,&rdquo; echoed Will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do?&rdquo; said all at once. There was a short
pause&mdash;after which the matter was resumed by Dick, who was intended
for a parson, and therefore rather given to moralising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; quoth Dick&mdash;&ldquo;life&rsquo;s
uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say that,&rdquo; rejoined Bob; &ldquo;look at them
rats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony Dowlan&rsquo;s a hard-drinking man, and his mother had
fits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the same sort,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
knowing&mdash;he may be dead&mdash;if so, how could he cut our
hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Dick, like Brutus, paused for a reply. Bob produced one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good scheme, but it won&rsquo;t do; the likes of
him never does anything he&rsquo;s wanted to. He&rsquo;s the contrariest
ould thief in Ireland! I wish mama hadn&rsquo;t got a party; we&rsquo;d do
well enough but for that. Never mind, boys, I&rsquo;ve got it.
There&rsquo;s Mikey Brian, he&rsquo;s the boy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To cut the hair of the whole of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t! wait, a-cushla, till I tell you, or, what&rsquo;s
better, show you. Come now, you devils. Look at the heels (Rasper&rsquo;s
and Scrub&rsquo;s) of them ponies! Did ever you see anything like
them!&mdash;look at the cutting there&mdash;Tony Dowlan never had the
knack o&rsquo; that tasty work in his dirty finger and thumb&mdash;and who
done that? Why Mikey Brian&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I see him myself; and
isn&rsquo;t he the boy that can &lsquo;bang Bannaker&rsquo; at anything!
Oh! he&rsquo;ll cut us elegant!&mdash;he&rsquo;ll do the squad for a
fi&rsquo;penny&mdash;and then, lads, there&rsquo;s them five others will
be just one a-piece to buy gut and flies! Come on, you
Hessians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner proposed than acceded to&mdash;off we set, for the eulogised
&ldquo;Bannaker banging Mikey Brian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stout, handsome boy he was&mdash;rising four-and-twenty&mdash;a
fighting, kissing, rollicking, ball-playing, dancing vagabone, as
you&rsquo;d see in a day&rsquo;s march&mdash;such a fellow as you only
meet in Ireland&mdash;a bit of a gardener, a bit of a groom, a bit of a
futboy, and a bit of a horse-docthor.</p>
<p>We reached the stables by the back way, and there, in his own peculiar
loft, was Mikey Brian, brushing a somewhat faded livery, in which to wait
upon the coming quality.</p>
<p>Bob stated the case, as far as the want of our locks&rsquo; curtailment
went, but made no mention of the delay which occasioned our coming to
Mikey; on the contrary, he attributed the preference solely to our
conviction of his superior abilities, and the wish to give him a chance,
as he felt convinced, if he had fair play, he&rsquo;d be engaged miles
round, instead of the hopping old shaver at Kells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your man, Masther Robert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;there&rsquo;s the fi&rsquo;penny&mdash;that&rsquo;s
for the lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, sit down&mdash;will you have the Currah
thoro&rsquo;bred-cut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, young gentlement, as there ain&rsquo;t much room&mdash;and
if you do be all looking on, I&rsquo;ll be bothered&mdash;just come in one
by one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out we went, and, in an inconceivably short space, Bob emerged.</p>
<p>Mikey advising: &ldquo;Master Robert, dear, keep your hat on for the
life of you, for fear of cowld.&rdquo; A few minutes finished us all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is elegant,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Mikey, it will be the
making of you; but don&rsquo;t say a word till you hear how they&rsquo;ll
praise you at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum!&rdquo; said Mikey, and off we rushed.</p>
<p>I felt rather astonished at the ease with which my hat sat; while those
of the rest appeared ready to fall over their noses. Being in a hurry,
this was passed over. The second dinner-bell rang&mdash;we bolted up for a
brief ablution&mdash;our hats were thrown into a corner, and, as if by one
consent, all eyes were fixed upon each other&rsquo;s heads!</p>
<p>Bob gave tongue: &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s skewer to Mikey Brian! and
bad luck to the Currah thoro&rsquo;bred cut! Not the eighth part of an
inch of &lsquo;air there is amongst the set of us. What will the master
say? Never mind; we&rsquo;ve got the fi&rsquo;pennies! Come to
dinner!&mdash;by the Puck we are beauties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the dining-room unperceived; but who can describe the agony
of my aunt Kate, when she clapped her eyes upon five such close-clipped
scarecrows. She vowed vengence of all sorts and descriptions against the
impudent, unnatural, shameful monster! Terms which Mikey Brian, in the
back-ground, appropriated to himself, and with the utmost difficulty
restrained his rising wrath from breaking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; continued aunt Kate, &ldquo;what does he call
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the thoro&rsquo;bred Currah-cut, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said Bob, with one of his peculiar glances at Mikey and the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mighty cool wearing, I&rsquo;ll be bail,&rdquo; muttered
Mikey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he call that hair-cutting?&rdquo; screamed my aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, and nothing but it,&rdquo; quietly retorted Bob, passing
his hand over his head; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t deny the cutting,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young gentlemen look elegant,&rdquo; said Mikey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s all the go, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said my aunt, with suppressed rage; &ldquo;wait
till I go to Kells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did not happen for six weeks; our aunt&rsquo;s anger was mollified
as our locks were once more human. Upon upbraiding &ldquo;Tony
Knowlan&rdquo; the murder came out. A hearty laugh ensured our pardon, and
Mikey Brian&rsquo;s; and the story of the &ldquo;thoro&rsquo;bred
Currah-cut&rdquo; was often told, as the means by which &ldquo;we all got
a fi&rsquo;penny bit a-piece.&rdquo;&mdash;FUSBOS.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is a portrait of a person so like him, that, the other day, a
friend who called took no notice whatever of the man, further than saying
he was a good likeness, but asked the portrait to dinner, and only found
out his mistake when he went up to shake hands with it at parting.</p>
<hr />
<p>An American hearing that there was a fire in his neighbourhood, and
that it might possibly consume his house, took the precaution to
<em>bolt</em> his own door; that he might be, so far at least, beforehand
with the <em>devouring</em> element.</p>

<h2>NARRATIVE OF AN AWFUL CASE OF EXTREME DISTRESS.</h2>
<p>It was in the year 1808, that myself and seven others resolved upon
taking chambers in Staples&rsquo; Inn. Our avowed object was to study, but
we had in reality assembled together for the purposes of convivial
enjoyment, and what were then designated &ldquo;sprees.&rdquo; Our stock
consisted of four hundred and twelve pounds, which we had drawn from our
parents and guardians under the various pretences of paying fees and
procuring books for the advancement of our knowledge in the sublime
mysteries of that black art called Law. In addition to our pecuniary
resources, we had also a fair assortment of wearing-apparel, and it was
well for us that parental anxiety had provided most of us with a change of
garments suitable to the various seasons. For a long time everything went
on riotously and prosperously. We visited the Theatres, the Coal-hole, the
Cider-cellars, and the Saloon, and became such ardent admirers of the
&ldquo;Waterford system of passing a night and morning,&rdquo; that
scarcely a day came without a draft upon the treasury for that legal
imposition upon the liberty of the subject&mdash;the five-shilling fine;
besides the discharge of promissory notes as compensation for trifling
damages done to the heads and property of various individuals.</p>
<p>About a month after the formation of our association we were all
suffering severely from thirsty head-aches, produced, I am convinced, by
the rapid consumption of thirteen bowls of whiskey-punch on the preceding
night. The rain was falling in perpendicular torrents, and the whole
aspect of out-of-door nature was gloomy and sloppy, when we were alarmed
by the exclamation of Joseph Jones (a relation of the Welsh Joneses), who
officiated as our treasurer, and upon inquiring the cause, were
horror-stricken to find that we had arrived at our last ten-pound note,
and that the landlord had sent an imperative message, requiring the
immediate settlement of our back-rent. It is impossible to paint the
consternation depicted on every countenance, already sufficiently
disordered by previous suffering and biliary disarrangement.</p>
<p>I was the first to speak; for being the son of a shabby-genteel father,
I had witnessed in my infancy many of those schemes to raise the needful,
to which ambitious men with limited incomes are so frequently driven. I
therefore bid them be of good heart, for that any pawnbroker in the
neighbourhood would readily advance money upon the superfluous wardrobe
which we possessed. This remark was received with loud cheers, which, I
have no doubt, would have been much more vehement but from the fatal
effects of the whiskey-punch.</p>
<p>The landlord&rsquo;s claim was instantly discharged, and after several
pots of strong green tea, rendered innocuous by brandy, we sallied forth
in pursuit of what we then ignorantly conceived to be pleasure.</p>
<p>I will not pause to particularise the gradual diminution of our
property, but come at once to that period when, having consumed all our
superfluities, it become a serious subject of consideration, what should
next be sacrificed.</p>
<p>I will now proceed to make extracts from our general diary, merely
premising that our only attendant was an asthmatic individual named
Peter.</p>
<p><em>Dec. 2, 1808.</em>&mdash;Peter reported stock&mdash;eight coats,
eight waistcoats, eight pairs of trousers, two ounces of coffee, half a
quartern loaf, and a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of milk. The eight waistcoats
required for dinner. Peter ordered to pop accordingly&mdash;proceeds
7<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> Invested in a small leg of mutton and
half-and-half.</p>
<p><em>Dec. 3.</em>&mdash;Peter reported stock&mdash;coats <em>idem</em>,
trousers <em>idem</em>&mdash;a mutton bone&mdash;rent due&mdash;a coat and
a pair of trousers ordered for immediate necessities&mdash;lots
drawn&mdash;Jones the victim. Moved the court to grant him his trousers,
as his coat was lined with silk, which would furnish the
trimmings&mdash;rejected. Peter popped the suit, and Jones went to bed.
All signed an undertaking to redeem Jones with the first remittance from
the country. Proceeds 40<em>s.</em> Paid rent, and dined on
&agrave;-la-mode beef and potatoes&mdash;beer limited to one quart. Peter
hinted at wages, and was remonstrated with on the folly and cruelty of his
conduct.</p>
<p><em>Dec. 4.</em>&mdash;Peter reported stock&mdash;seven coats, seven
pairs of trousers, and a gentleman in bed. Washerwoman called&mdash;gave
notice of detaining linen unless settled with&mdash;two coats and one pair
of trousers ordered for consumption. Lots drawn&mdash;Smith the victim for
coat and trousers&mdash;Brown for the continuations only. Smith retired to
bed&mdash;Brown obtained permission to sit in a blanket. Proceeds of the
above, 38<em>s.</em>&mdash;both pairs of trousers having been reseated.
Jones very violent, declaring it an imposition, and that every gentleman
who had been repaired, should enter himself so on the books. The linen
redeemed, leaving&mdash;nothing for dinner.</p>
<p><em>Dec. 5.</em>&mdash;Peter reported stock&mdash;four coats, and five
pairs of trousers. Account not agreeing, Peter was called in&mdash;found
that Williams had bolted&mdash;Jones offered to call him out, if we would
dress him for the day&mdash;Smith undertook to negotiate preliminaries on
the same conditions&mdash;Williams voted not worth powder and shot in the
present state of our finances. A coat and two pair of continuations
ordered for supplies&mdash;lots drawn&mdash;Black and Edwards the victims.
Black retired to bed, and Edwards to a blanket&mdash;proceeds,
20<em>s.</em> Jones, Smith, and Black, petitioned for an increased supply
of coals&mdash;agreed to. Dinner, a large leg of mutton and baked
potatoes. Peter lodged a detainer against the change, as he wanted his
hair cut and a box of vegetable pills&mdash;so he said.</p>
<p><em>Dec. 6.</em>&mdash;Peter reported stock&mdash;three coats, three
pairs of trousers, quarter of a pound of mutton, and one potato. Landlord
sent a note remonstrating against using the beds all day, and applying the
blankets to the purposes of dressing-gowns. Proposed, in consequence of
this impertinent communication, that the payment of the next week&rsquo;s
rent be disputed&mdash;carried <em>nem. con</em>. A coat and a pair of
trousers ordered for the day&rsquo;s necessities&mdash;Peter popped as
usual&mdash;proceeds, 10<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>&mdash;coals
bought&mdash;ditto a quire of paper, and the <em>et cets</em>. for home
correspondence. Blue devils very prevalent.</p>
<p><em>Dec. 7.</em>&mdash;Peter reported stock&mdash;two coats, two pairs
of trousers, and five gentlemen in bed. Smith hinted at the
&ldquo;beauties of <em>Burke</em>&ldquo;&mdash;Peter brought a note for
Jones&mdash;everybody in ecstacy&mdash;Jones&rsquo;s jolly old uncle from
Glamorganshire had arrived in town. Huzza! safe for a 20<em>l.</em> Busker
(<em>that&rsquo;s myself</em>) volunteered his suit&mdash;Jones dressed
and off in a brace of shakes&mdash;caught Peter laughing&mdash;found it
was a hoax of Jones&rsquo;s to give us the slip&mdash;would have stripped
Peter, only his clothes were worth nothing&mdash;calculated the produce of
the remaining suit at&mdash;</p>
<table summary="Proceeds from the suit" style="margin-left:10%;">

<p>Caught an idea.&mdash;wrote an anonymous letter to the landlord, and
told him that an association had been formed to burke Colonel
Sibthorp&mdash;his lodgers the conspirators&mdash;that the scheme was
called the &ldquo;Lie-a-bed plot&rdquo;&mdash;poverty with his lodgers all
fudge&mdash;men of immense wealth&mdash;get rid of them for his own
sake&mdash;old boy very nervous, having been in quod for
smuggling&mdash;gave us warning&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t go if we would.
Landlord redeemed our clothes. Ha! ha!&mdash;did him brown.</p>
<p>The above is a statement of what I suffered during my minority. I have
now the honour to be a magistrate and a member of Parliament.</p>

<h3>THE QUEEN&rsquo;S SPEECH.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
<p class="i10">This morn at crow-cock,</p>
<p class="i10">Great Doctor Locock</p>
<p>Decided that her Majesty had better</p>
<p>Remain at home, for (as <em>I</em> read the letter)</p>
<p>He thought the opening speech</p>
<p>Would be &ldquo;more honoured in the breach</p>
<p>Than the observance.&rdquo; So here I am,</p>
<p>To read a royal speech without a flam.</p>
<p>Her Majesty continues to receive</p>
<p>From Foreign Powers good reasons to believe</p>
<p>That, for the universe, they would not tease her,</p>
<p>But do whate&rsquo;er they could on earth to please her.</p>
<p class="i8">A striking fact,</p>
<p class="i8">That proves each act</p>
<p>Of <em>us</em>, the Cabinet, has been judicious,</p>
<p>Though of our conduct <em>some</em> folks <em>are</em> suspicious.</p>
<p>Her Majesty has also satisfaction</p>
<p>To state the July treaty did succeed</p>
<p>(Aided, no doubt, by Napier&rsquo;s gallant action),</p>
<p>And that in peace the Sultan smokes his weed.</p>
<p>That France, because she was left out,</p>
<p>Did for a little while&mdash;now bounce&mdash;now pout,</p>
<p>Is in the best of humours, and will still</p>
<p>Lend us her Jullien, monarch of quadrille!</p>
<p>And as her Majesty&rsquo;s a peaceful woman,</p>
<p>She hopes we shall get into rows with no man.</p>
<p>Her Majesty is also glad to say,</p>
<p>That as the Persian troops have march&rsquo;d away,</p>
<p>Her Minister has orders to resume</p>
<p>His powers at Teheran, where he&rsquo;s ta&rsquo;en a room.</p>
<p>Her Majesty regrets that the Chinese</p>
<p>Are running up the prices of our teas:</p>
<p>But should the Emperor continue crusty,</p>
<p>Elliot&rsquo;s to find out if his jacket&rsquo;s dusty.</p>
<p>Her Majesty has also had the pleasure</p>
<p>(By using a conciliatory measure)</p>
<p>To settle Spain and Portugal&rsquo;s division</p>
<p>About the Douro treaty&rsquo;s true provision.</p>
<p>Her Majesty (she grieves to say) &rsquo;s contrived to get,</p>
<p>Like all her predecessors, into debt&mdash;</p>
<p>In Upper Canada, which, we suppose,</p>
<p>By this time is a fact the Council knows,</p>
<p>And what they think, or say, or write about it,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll he advised of, and the Queen don&rsquo;t doubt it,</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll contrive to make the thing all square,</p>
<p>So leaves the matter to your loyal care.</p>
<p class="i4">GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,</p>
<p>Her Majesty, I&rsquo;m proud to say, relies</p>
<p>On you with confidence for the supplies;</p>
<p>And, as there&rsquo;s much to pay, she begs to hint</p>
<p>She hopes sincerely you&rsquo;ll not spare the Mint.</p>
<p class="i4">MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
<p>The public till,</p>
<p>I much regret to say, is looking ill;</p>
<p>For Canada and China, and the Whigs&mdash;no, no&mdash;</p>
<p>Some other prigs&mdash;have left the cash so-so:</p>
<p>But as our soldiers and our tars, brave lads,</p>

<h2>THE DINNEROLOGY OF ENGLAND.</h2>
<p>Man is the only animal that cooks his dinner before he eats it. All
other species of the same genus are content to take the provisions of
nature as they find them; but man&rsquo;s reason has designed pots and
roasting-jacks, stewpans and bakers&rsquo; ovens; thus opening a wide
field for the exercise of that culinary ingenuity which has rendered the
names of Glasse and Kitchiner immortal. Of such importance is the
gastronomic art to the well-being of England, that we question much if the
&ldquo;wooden walls,&rdquo; which have been the theme of many a song,
afford her the same protection as her dinners. The ancients sought, by the
distribution of crowns and flowers, to stimulate the enterprising and
reward the successful; but England, despising such empty honours and
distinctions, tempts the diffident with a haunch of venison, and rewards
the daring with real turtle.</p>
<p>If charity seeks the aid of the benevolent, she no longer trusts to the
magic of oratory to &ldquo;melt the tender soul to pity,&rdquo; and untie
the purse-strings; but, grown wise by experience, she sends in her card in
the shape of &ldquo;a guinea ticket, bottle of wine included;&rdquo; and
thus appeals, if not to the heart, at least to its next-door
neighbour&mdash;the stomach.</p>
<p>The hero is no longer conducted to the temple of Victory amid the
shouts of his grateful and admiring countrymen, but to the
Freemason&rsquo;s, the Crown and Anchor, or the Town Hall, there to have
his plate heaped with the choicest viands, his glass tilled from the best
bins, and &ldquo;his health drank with three times three, and a little one
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bard has now to experience &ldquo;the happiest moment of his
life&rdquo; amid the jingling of glasses, the rattle of dessert plates,
and the stentorian vociferations of the toast-master to &ldquo;charge your
glasses, gentlemen&mdash;Mr. Dionysius Dactyl, the ornament of the age,
with nine times nine,&rdquo; and to pour out the flood of his poetic
gratitude, with half a glass of port in one hand and a table-napkin in the
other.</p>
<p>The Cicero who has persuaded an enlightened body of electors to receive
&pound;10,000 decimated amongst them, and has in return the honour of
sleeping in &ldquo;St. Stephen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and smoking in
&ldquo;Bellamy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; or, to be less figurative, who has been
returned as their representative in Parliament, receives the foretaste of
his importance in a &ldquo;public dinner,&rdquo; which commemorates his
election; or should he desire to express &ldquo;the deep sense of his
gratitude,&rdquo; like Lord Mahon at Hertford, he cannot better prove his
sincerity than by the liberal distribution of invitations for the
unrestrained consumption of mutton, and the unlimited imbibition of
&ldquo;foreign wines and spirituous liquors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a renegade, like Sir Francis Burdett, is desirous of making his
apostacy the theme of general remark&mdash;of surprising the world with an
exhibition of prostrated worth&mdash;let him not seek the market-cross to
publish his dishonour, whilst there remains the elevated chair at a
dinner-table. Let him prove himself entitled to be ranked as a man, by the
elaborate manner in which he seasons his soup or anatomises a joint. Let
him have the glass and the towel&mdash;the one to cool the tongue, which
must burn with the fulsome praises of those whom he has hitherto decried,
and the other as a ready appliance to conceal the blush which must rush to
the cheek from the consciousness of the thousand recollections of former
professions awakened in the minds of every applauder of his apostacy. Let
him have a Toole to give bold utterance to the toasts which, in former
years, would have called forth his contumely and indignation, and which,
even now, he dare only whisper, lest the echo of his own voice should be
changed into a curse. Let him have wine, that his blood may riot through
his veins and drive memory onward. Let him have wine, that when the hollow
cheers of his new allies ring in his ears he may be incapable of
understanding their real meaning; or, when he rises to respond to the
lip-service of his fellow bacchanals, the fumes may supply the place of
mercy, and save him from the abjectness of self-degradation. Burdett! the
20th of August will never be forgotten! You have earned an epitaph that
will scorch men&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>Who that possesses the least reflection ever visited a police-office
without feeling how intimately it was connected with the cook-shop! The
victims to the intoxicating qualities of pickled salmon, oyster-sauce, and
lobster salad, are innumerable; for where one gentleman or lady pleads
guilty to too much wine, a thousand extenuate on the score of indigestion.
We are aware that the disorganisation of the digestive powers is very
prevalent&mdash;about one or two in the morning&mdash;and we have no doubt
the Conservative friends of Captain Rous, who patriotically contributed
five shillings each to the Queen, and one gentleman (a chum of our own at
Cheam, if we mistake not) a sovereign to the poor-box, were all
doubtlessly suffering from this cause, combined with their enthusiasm for
the gallant Rous, and&mdash;<em>proh pudor!</em>&mdash;Burdett.</p>
<p>How much, then, are we indebted to our cooks! those perspiring
professors of gastronomy and their valuable assistants&mdash;the
industrious scullery-maids. Let not the Melbourne opposition to this
meritorious class, be supported by the nation at large; for England would
soon cease to occupy her present proud pre-eminence, did her rulers, her
patriots, and her heroes, sit down to cold mutton, or the villanously
dressed &ldquo;joints ready from 12 to 5.&rdquo; Justice is said to be the
foundation of all national prosperity&mdash;we contend that it is
repletion&mdash;that Mr. Toole, the toast-master, is the only embodiment
of fame, and that true glory consists of a gratuitous participation in
&ldquo;Three courses and a dessert!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>TO POLITICAL WRITERS,</h3>
<h4>AND TO THE EDITOR OF THE &ldquo;TIMES&rdquo; IN PARTICULAR.</h4>
<p>Mr. Solomons begs to announce to reporters of newspapers, that he has
constructed, at a very great expense, several sets of new glasses, which
will enable the wearer to see as small or as great a number of auditors,
at public conferences and political meetings, as may suit his purpose. Mr.
Solomons has also invented a new kind of ear-trumpet, which will enable a
reporter to hear only such portions of an harangue as may be in accordance
with his political bias; or should there be nothing uttered by any speaker
that may suit his purpose, these ear-trumpets will change the sounds of
words and the construction of sentences in such a way as to be
incontrovertible, although every syllable should be diverted from its
original meaning and intention. They have also the power of larding a
speech with &ldquo;loud cheers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;strong
disapprobation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These valuable inventions have been in use for some years by Mr.
Solomons&rsquo; respected friend, the editor of the <em>Times</em>; but no
publicity has been given to them, until Mr. S. had completely tested their
efficacy. He has now much pleasure in subjoining, for the information of
the public, the following letter, of the authenticity of which Mr. S.
presumes no one can entertain a doubt.</p>
<h4>LETTER FROM THE EDITOR OF THE &ldquo;TIMES.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>It is with much pleasure that I am enabled, my dear Solomons, to give
my humble testimony in favour of your new political glasses and
ear-trumpet. By their invaluable aid I have been enabled, for some years,
to see and hear just what suited my purpose. I have recommended them to my
<em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em>, Sir Robert Peel, who has already tried the
glasses, and, I am happy to state, does not see quite so many objections
to a fixed duty as he did before using these wonderful illuminators. The
gallant Sibthorp (at my recommendation) carried one of your ear-trumpets
to the House on Friday last, and states that he heard his honoured leader
declare, &ldquo;that the Colonel was the only man who ought to be
Premier&mdash;after himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If these testimonies are of any value to you, publish them by all
means, and believe me.</p>
<p class="rgt">Yours faithfully,<br />
JOHN WALTER.<br />

<p>Mr. S. begs to state, that though magnifying and diminishing glasses
are no novelty, yet his invention is the only one to suit the interest of
parties without principle.</p>

<h3>AWFUL ACCIDENT.</h3>
<p>Our reporter has just forwarded an authentic statement, in which he
vouches, with every appearance of truth, that &ldquo;Lord Melbourne dined
at home on Wednesday last.&rdquo; The neighbourhood is in an agonising
state of excitement.</p>
<h4>FURTHER PARTICULARS.</h4>
<h5>(<em>Particularly exclusive</em>.)</h5>
<p>Our readers will be horrified to learn the above is not the whole
extent of this alarming event. From a private source of the highest
possible credit, we are informed that his &ldquo;Lordship also took
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>FURTHEST PARTICULARS.</h4>
<p>Great Heavens! when will our painful duties end? We tremble as we
write,&mdash;may we be deceived!&mdash;but we are compelled to announce
the agonising fact&mdash;&ldquo;he also supped!&rdquo;</p>
<h4>BY EXPRESS.</h4>
<h5>(<em>From our own reporter on the spot</em>!)</h5>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;&ldquo;The dinner is fatally true! but, I am happy to
state, there are doubts about the tea, and you may almost wholly
contradict the supper.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>SECOND EXPRESS.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I have only time to say, things are not so bad! The tea is
disproved, and the supper was a gross exaggeration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N.B. My horse is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<h4>THIRD EXPRESS.</h4>
<p>Hurrah! Glorious news! There is no truth in the above fearful rumour;
it is false from beginning to end, and, doubtless, had its vile origin
from some of the &ldquo;adverse faction,&rdquo; as it is clearly of such a
nature as to convulse the country. To what meanness will not these Tories
stoop, for the furtherance of their barefaced schemes of oppression and
pillage! The facts they have so grossly distorted with their tortuous
ingenuity and demoniac intentions, are simply these:&mdash;A saveloy was
ordered by one of the upper servants (who is on board wages, and finds his
own kitchen fire), the boy entrusted with its delivery mistook the footman
for his lordship. This is very unlikely, as the man is willing to make an
affidavit he had &ldquo;just cleaned himself,&rdquo; and therefore, it is
clear the boy must have been a paid emissary. But the public will be
delighted to learn, to prevent the possibility of future
mistakes&mdash;&ldquo;John&rdquo; has been denuded of his
whiskers&mdash;the only features which, on a careful examination,
presented the slightest resemblance to his noble master. In fact,
otherwise the fellow is remarkably good-looking.</p>

<h2>HINTS TO NEW MEMBERS.</h2>
<h3>BY AN OLD TRIMMER.</h3>
<p>It being now an established axiom that every member goes into
Parliament for the sole purpose of advancing his own private interest, and
not, as has been ignorantly believed, for the benefit of his country or
the constituency he represents, it becomes a matter of vast importance to
those individuals who have not had the advantage of long experience in the
house, to be informed of the mode usually adopted by honourable members in
the discharge of their legislative duties. With this view the writer, who
has, for the last thirty years, done business on both sides of the house,
and always with the strictest regard to the main chance, has collected a
number of hints for the guidance of juvenile members, of which the
following are offered as a sample:&mdash;</p>
<p>HINT 1.&mdash;It is a vulgar error to imagine that a man, to be a
member of Parliament, requires either education, talents, or honesty: all
that it is necessary for him to possess is&mdash;impudence and humbug!</p>
<p>HINT 2.&mdash;When a candidate addresses a constituency, he should
promise everything. Some men will only pledge themselves to what their
conscience considers right. Fools of this sort can never hope to be</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/007-06.png"><img src=
"images/007-06.png" alt="A man gets kicked out of a door by many feet."
id="img007-06" name="img007-06" width="50%" /></a>
<p>RETURNED BY A LARGE MAJORITY.</p>
</div>
<p>HINT 3.&mdash;Oratory is a showy, but by no means necessary,
accomplishment in the house. If a member knows when to say
&ldquo;Ay&rdquo; or &ldquo;No,&rdquo; it is quite sufficient for all
useful purposes.</p>
<p>HINT 4.&mdash;If, however, a young member should be seized with, the
desire of speaking in Parliament, he may do so without the slighest regard
to sense, as the reporters in the gallery are paid for the purpose of
making speeches for honourable members; and on the following morning he
may calculate on seeing, in the columns of the daily papers, a full report
of his splendid</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/007-07.png"><img src=
"images/007-07.png" alt="A young woman tells her swain 'I'll ask my Ma!'"
id="img007-07" name="img007-07" width="50%" /></a>
<p>MAIDEN SPEECH.</p>
</div>
<p>HINT 5.&mdash;A knowledge of the exact time to cry &ldquo;Hear,
hear!&rdquo; is absolutely necessary. A severe cough, when a member of the
opposite side of the house is speaking, is greatly to be commended;
cock-crowing is also a desirable qualification for a young legislator,
and, if judiciously practised, cannot fail to bring the possessor into the
notice of his party.</p>
<p>HINT 6.&mdash;The back seats in the gallery are considered, by several
members, as the most comfortable for taking a nap on.</p>
<p>HINT 7.&mdash;If one honourable member wishes to tell another
honourable member that he is anything but a gentleman, he should be
particular to do so within the walls of the house&mdash;as, in that case,
the Speaker will put him under arrest, to prevent any unpleasant
consequences arising from his hasty expressions.</p>
<p>HINT 8.&mdash;If a member promise to give his vote to the minister, he
must in honour do so&mdash;unless he happen to fall asleep in the
smoking-room, and so gets shut out from the division of the house.</p>
<p>HINT 9.&mdash;No independent member need trouble himself to understand
the merits of any question before the house. He may, therefore, amuse
himself at Bellamy&rsquo;s until five minutes before the Speaker&rsquo;s
bell rings for a division.</p>

<h3>NOVEL EXPERIMENT.&mdash;GREAT SCREW.</h3>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S INFORMATION FOR THE PEOPLE.&mdash;NO. 3.</h2>
<p>One of the expedients adopted by the cheap-knowledge-mongers to convey
so-called &ldquo;information&rdquo; to the vulgar, has been, we flatter
ourselves, successfully imitated in our articles on the Stars and the
Thermometer. They are by writers engaged expressly for the respective
subjects, because they will work cheaply and know but little of what they
are writing about, and therefore make themselves the better understood by
the equally ignorant. We do hope that they have not proved themselves
behindhand in popular humbug and positive error, and that the blunders in
&ldquo;the Thermometer&rdquo;<sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote">3. One of
these blunders the author must not be commended for; it is attributable to
a facetious mistake of the printer. In giving the etymology of the
Thermometer, it should have been &ldquo;measure of <em>heat</em>,&rdquo;
and not &ldquo;measure of <em>feet</em>.&rdquo; We scorn to deprive our
devil of a joke so worthy of him.</span> are equally as amusing as those
of the then big-wig who wrote the treatise on &ldquo;Animal
Mechanics,&rdquo; published by our rival Society for Diffusing Useful
Knowledge.</p>
<p>Another of their methods for obtaining cheap knowledge it is now our
intention to adopt. Having got the poorest and least learned authors we
could find (of course for cheapness) for our former pieces of information,
we have this time engaged a gentleman to mystify a few common-place
subjects, in the style of certain articles in the &ldquo;Penny
Cyclop&aelig;dia.&rdquo; As his erudition is too profound for ordinary
comprehensions&mdash;as he scorns gain&mdash;as the books he has hitherto
published (no, privated) have been printed at his own expense, for the
greater convenience of reading them himself, for nobody else does
so&mdash;as, in short, he is in reality a cheap-knowledge man, seeing that
he scorns pay, and we scorn to pay him&mdash;we have concluded an
engagement with him for fourteen years.</p>
<p>The subject on which we have directed him to employ his vast scientific
acquirements, is one which must come home to the firesides of the married
and the bosoms of the single, namely, the art of raising a flame; in
humble imitation of some of Young&rsquo;s Knights&rsquo; Thoughts, which
are directed to the object of lightening the darkness of servants,
labourers, artisans, and chimney-sweeps, and in providing guides to the
trades or services of which they are already masters or mistresses. We beg
to present our readers with</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 1.</h3>
<h4>ON THE PROCESS AND RATIONALE OF LIGHTING FIRES.</h4>
<p>Take a small cylindrical aggregation of parallelopedal sections of the
ligneous fibre (vulgarly denominated a bundle of fire-wood), and arrange a
fractional part of the integral quantity rectilineally along the interior
of the igneous receptacle known as a grate, so as to form an acute angle
(of, say 25&deg;) with its base; and one (of, say 65&deg;) with the
posterior plane that is perpendicular to it; taking care at the same time
to leave between each parallelopedal section an insterstice isometrical
with the smaller sides of any one of their six quadrilateral superficies,
so as to admit of the free circulation of the atmospheric fluid.
Superimposed upon this, arrange several moderate-sized concretions of the
hydro-carburetted substance (<em>vulgo</em> coal), approximating in figure
as nearly as possible to the rhombic dodecahedron, so that the solid
angles of each concretion may constitute the different points of contact
with those immediately adjacent. Insert into the cavity formed by the
imposition of the ligneous fibre upon the inferior transverse ferruginous
bar, a sheet of laminated lignin, or paper, compressed by the action of
the digits into an irregular spheroid.</p>
<p>These preliminary operations having been skilfully performed, the
process of combustion may be commenced. For this purpose, a smaller woody
paralleloped&mdash;the extremities of which have been previously dipped in
sulphur in a state of liquefaction&mdash;must be ignited and applied to
the laminated lignin, or waste paper, and so elevate its temperature to a
degree required for its combustion, which will be communicated to the
ligneous superstructure; this again raises the temperature of the
hydro-carburet concretion, and liberates its carburetted hydrogen in the
form of gas; which gas, combining with the oxygen of the atmosphere,
enters into combustion, and a general ignition ensues. This, in point of
fact, constitutes what is popularly termed&mdash;&ldquo;lighting a
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an action lately tried at the Cork Assizes, a lady obtained
<em>fifteen hundred pounds damages</em>, for a breach of promise of
marriage, against a faithless lover. Lady Morgan sends us the following
trifle on the subject:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>What! <em>fifteen hundred!</em>&mdash;&rsquo;tis a sum severe;</p>
<p class="i2">The fine by far the injury o&rsquo;erreaches.</p>
<p>For <em>one</em> poor <em>breach</em> of promise &rsquo;tis too
dear&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">&rsquo;Twould be sufficient for a <em>pair of
breaches</em>!</p>

<h2>SCHOOL OF DESIGN.</h2>
<p>Several designing individuals, whose talents for <em>drawing</em> on
paper are much greater than those of Charles Kean for drawing upon the
stage, met together at Somerset House, on Monday last, to distribute
prizes among their scholars. Prince Albert presided, gave away the prizes
with great suavity, and made a speech which occupied exactly two seconds
and a-half.</p>
<p>The first prize was awarded to Master Palmerston, for a successful
<em>design</em> for completely frustrating certain commercial
<em>views</em> upon China, and for his new invention of
<em>auto-painting</em>. Prize: an order upon Truefit for a new wig.</p>
<p>Master John Russell was next called up.&mdash;This talented young
gentleman had designed a gigantic &ldquo;penny loaf;&rdquo; which,
although too immense for practical use, yet, his efforts having been
exclusively directed to fanciful design, and not to practical possibility,
was highly applauded. Master Russell also evinced a highly precocious
talent for <em>drawing</em>&mdash;his salary. Prize: a splendidly-bound
copy of the New Marriage Act.</p>
<p>The fortunate candidate next upon the list, was Master Normanby. This
young gentleman brought forward a beautiful design for a new prison, so
contrived for criminals to be excluded from light and society, in any
degree proportionate with their crimes. This young gentleman was brought
up in Ireland, but there evinced considerable talent in <em>drawing</em>
prisoners out of durance vile. He was much complimented on the salutary
effect upon his studies, which his pupilage at the school of design had
wrought. Prize: an order from Colburn for a new novel.</p>
<p>Master Melbourne, who was next called up, seemed a remarkably fine boy
of his age, though a little too old for his short jacket. He had
signalised himself by an exceedingly elaborate <em>design</em> for the
Treasury benches. This elicited the utmost applause; for, by this plan,
the seats were so ingeniously contrived, that, once occupied, it would be
a matter of extreme difficulty for the sitter to be
<em>absquatulated</em>, even by main force. Prize: a free ticket to the
licensed victuallers&rsquo; dinner.</p>
<p>The Prince then withdrew, amidst the acclamations of the assembled
multitude.</p>

<h3>A HINT TO THE NEW LORD CHAMBERLAIN.</h3>
<p>There is always much difference of opinion existing as to the number of
theatres which ought to be licensed in the metropolis. Our friend Peter
Borthwick, whose mathematical acquirements are only equalled by his
&ldquo;<em>heavy fathers</em>,&rdquo; has suggested the following formula
whereby to arrive at a just conclusion:&mdash;Take the number of theatres,
multiply by the public-houses, and divide by the dissenting chapels, and
the quotient will be the answer. This is what Peter calls</p>

<h3>VOCAL EVASION.</h3>
<p>LADY B&mdash;&mdash; (who, it is rumoured, has an eye to the
bedchamber) was interrogating Sir Robert Peel a little closer than the
wily minister <em>in futuro</em> approved of. After several very evasive
answers, which had no effect on the lady&rsquo;s pertinacity, Sir Robert
made her a graceful bow, and retired, humming the favourite air
of&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;OH! I CANNOT GIVE EXPRESSION.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h3>A PUN FROM THE ROW.</h3>
<p>It is asserted that a certain eminent medical man lately offered to a
publisher in Paternoster-row a &ldquo;Treatise on the Hand,&rdquo; which
the worthy bibliopole declined with a shake of the head, saying, &ldquo;My
dear sir, we have got too many <em>treatises on our hands</em>
already.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>PLEASURES OF HOPE (RATHER EXPENSIVE).</h3>
<p>The <em>Commerce</em> states &ldquo;the cost of the mansion now
building for Mr. Hope, in the Rue St. Dominique, including furniture and
objects of art, is estimated at six hundred thousand
pounds!&rdquo;&mdash;[If this is an attribute of <em>Hope</em>, what is
reality?&mdash;ED. PUNCH.]</p>
<hr />
<h3>FASHIONS FOR THE MONTH.</h3>
<p>We perceive that the severity of the summer has prevented the entire
banishment of furs in the fashionable <em>quartiers</em> of the
metropolis. We noticed three fur caps, on Sunday last, in Seven Dials.
Beavers are, however, superseded by gossamers; the crowns of which are,
among the &eacute;lite of St. Giles&rsquo;s, jauntily opened to admit of
ventilation, in anticipation of the warm weather. Frieze coats are fast
giving way to pea-jackets; waistcoats, it is anticipated, will soon be
discarded, and brass buttons are completely out of vogue.</p>
<p>We have not noticed so many highlows as Bluchers upon the
understandings of the promenaders of Broad-street. Ancle-jacks are, we
perceive, universally adopted at the elegant <em>soir&eacute;es
dansantes</em>, nightly held at the &ldquo;Frog and Fiddle,&rdquo; in
Pye-street, Westminster.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ARTISTIC EXECUTION.</h3>
<p>We understand that Sir M.A. Shee is engaged in painting the portraits
of Sir Willoughhy Woolston Dixie and Mr. John Bell, the lately-elected
member for Thirsk, which are intended for the exhibition at the Royal
Academy. If Folliot Duff&rsquo;s account of their dastardly conduct in the
Waldegrave affair be correct, we cannot <em>imagine</em> two gentlemen
more worthy the labours of the</p>

<h3>NEW PARLIAMENTARY RETURNS.</h3>
<p>We have been informed, on authority upon which we have reason to place
much reliance, that several distinguished members of the upper and lower
houses of Parliament intend moving for the following important returns
early in the present session:&mdash;</p>
<h4>IN THE LORDS.</h4>
<p>Lord Palmerston will move for a return of all the <em>papillote</em>
papers contained in the red box at the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>The Duke of Wellington will move for a return of the Tory taxes.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Downshire will move for a return of his political
honesty.</p>
<p>Lord Melbourne will move for a return of place and power.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Westmeath will move for a return of the days when he was
young.</p>
<p>The Marquis Wellesley will move for a return of the pap-spoons
manufactured in England for the last three years.</p>
<h4>IN THE COMMONS.</h4>
<p>Sir Francis Burdett will move for a return of his popularity in
Westminster.</p>
<p>Lord John Russell will move that the return of the Tories to office is
extremely inconvenient.</p>
<p>Captain Rous will move for a return of the number of high-spirited
Tories who were conveyed on stretchers to the different station-houses, on
the night of the ever-to-be-remembered Drury-lane dinner.</p>
<p>Sir E.L. Bulwer will move for a return of all the half-penny ballads
published by Catnach and Co. during the last year.</p>
<p>Morgan O&rsquo;Connell will move for a return of all the brogues worn
by the bare-footed peasantry of Ireland.</p>
<p>Colonel Sibthorp will move for a return of his wits.</p>
<p>Peter Borthwick will move for a return of all the kettles convicted of
singing on the Sabbath-day.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Peel will move for a return of all the ladies of the
palace&mdash;to the places from whence they came.</p>
<p>Ben D&rsquo;Israeli will move for a return of all the hard words in
Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary.</p>
<hr />
<h3>RATHER OMINOUS!</h3>
<p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> states, that &ldquo;several of the
<em>heads</em> of the Conservative party held a conference at
<em>Whitehall</em> Gardens!&rdquo; <em>Heads</em> and <em>conferences</em>
have been cut short enough at the same place ere now!</p>

<h3>A MATTER OF COURSE.</h3>
<p>The match at cricket, between the Chelsea and Greenwich Pensioners, was
decided in favour of the latter. Captain Rous says, no great wonder,
considering the winners bad the majority of <em>legs</em> on their side.
The Hyllus affair has made him an authority.</p>

<h2>THE DRAMA.</h2>
<h3>THE ITALIAN OPERA.</h3>
<h4>RETIREMENT OF RUBINI.</h4>
<h5>(<em>Exclusive</em>.)</h5>
<p class="note">N.B.&mdash;PUNCH is delighted to perceive, from the style
of this critique, that, though anonymously sent, it is manifestly from the
pen of the elegant critic of the <em>Morning Post</em>.</p>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/007-12.png"><img src=
"images/007-12.png" alt="A couple at the opera, in an O-shaped frame." id=
"img007-12" name="img007-12" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">O</span>n a review of the events of the past season,
the <em>souvenirs</em> it presents are not calculated to elevate the
character of the arts <em>di poeta</em> and <em>di musica</em>, of which
the Italian Opera is composed. The only decided <em>nouveaut&eacute;s</em>
which made their appearance, were &ldquo;Fausta,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roberto
Devereux,&rdquo; both of them <em>jejune</em> as far as regards their
<em>libretto</em> and the <em>composita musicale</em>. The latter opera,
however, serving as it did to introduce a pleasing <em>rifacciamento</em>
of the lamented Malibran, in her talented sister Pauline (Madame Viardot),
may, on that account, be remembered as a pleasing reminiscence of the past
season.</p>
<p>The evening of Saturday, Aug. 21st, will long be remembered by the
<em>habitu&eacute;s</em> of the Opera. From exclusive sources (which have
been opened to us at a very considerable expense) we are enabled to
communicate&mdash;<em>malheureusement</em>&mdash;that with the close of
the <em>saison de</em> 1841, the <em>corps op&eacute;ratique</em> loses
one of its most brilliant ornaments. That memorable epocha was chosen by
Rubini for making a graceful <em>cong&eacute;</em> to a fashionable
audience, amidst an abundance of tears&mdash;shed in the choicest
Italian&mdash;and showers of <em>bouquets</em>. The subjects chosen for
representation were <em>apropos</em> in the extreme; all being of a
<em>triste</em> character, namely, the <em>atta terzo</em> of
&ldquo;Marino Faliero,&rdquo; the <em>finale</em> of &ldquo;Lucia di
Lammermoor,&rdquo; and the last <em>parte</em> of &ldquo;La
Sonnambula:&rdquo; these were the chosen vehicles for Rubini&rsquo;s
<em>soir&eacute;e d&rsquo;adieu</em>.</p>
<p>As this <em>tenor primissimo</em> has, in a professional
<em>regarde</em>, disappeared from amongst us&mdash;as the last echoes of
his <em>voix magnifique</em> have died away&mdash;as he has made a final
exit from the public <em>plafond</em> to the <em>coulisses</em> of private
life&mdash;we deem it due to future historians of the Italian Opera <em>de
Londres</em>, to record our admiration, our opinions, and our
<em>regrets</em> for this great <em>artiste</em>.</p>
<p>Signor Rubini is in stature what might be denominated <em>juste
milieu</em>; his <em>taille</em> is graceful, his <em>figure</em>
pleasing, his eyes full of expression, his hair bushy: his
<em>comport</em> upon the stage, when not excited by passion, is full of
<em>verve</em> and <em>brusquerie</em>, but in passages which the
<em>Maestro</em> has marked &ldquo;<em>con passione</em>&rdquo; nothing
can exceed the elegance of his attitudes, and the pleasing dignity of his
gestures. After, <em>par exemple</em>, the <em>recitativi</em>, what a
pretty <em>empressement</em> he gave (alas! that we must now speak in the
past tense!) to the <em>tonic</em> or <em>key-note</em>, by
<em>locking</em> his arms in each other over his
<em>poitrine</em>&mdash;by that after expansion of them&mdash;that clever
<em>alto</em> movement of the toes&mdash;that apparent embracing of the
<em>fumes des lampes</em>&mdash;how touching! Then, while the
<em>sinfonia</em> of the <em>andante</em> was in progress, how gracefully
he turned <em>son dos</em> to the delighted auditors, and made an
interesting <em>promenade au fond</em>, always contriving to get his
finely-arched nose over the <em>lumi&egrave;res</em> at the precise point
of time (we speak in a musical sense) where the word
&ldquo;<em>voce</em>&rdquo; is marked in the score. His pantomime to the
<em>allegri</em> was no less captivating; but it was in the
<em>stretta</em> that his beauty of action was most exquisitely apparent;
there, worked up by an elaborate <em>crescendo</em> (the <em>motivo</em>
of which is always, in the Italian school, a simple progression of the
diatonic scale), the <em>furor</em> with which this <em>cantratice</em>
hurried his hands into the thick clumps of his picturesque
<em>perruque</em>, and seemed to tear its <em>cheveux</em> out by the
roots (without, however, disturbing the celebrated side-parting a single
hair)&mdash;the vigour with which he beat his breast&mdash;his final
expansion of arms, elevation of toes, and the impressive <em>frappe</em>
of his right foot upon the stage immediately before disappearing behind
the <em>coulisses</em>&mdash;must be fresh in the <em>souvenir</em> of our
<em>dilettanti</em> readers.</p>
<p>But how shall we <em>parle</em> concerning his <em>voix</em>? That
exquisite organ, whose <em>falsetto</em> emulated the sweetness of flutes,
and reached to A flat <em>in altissimo</em>&mdash;the <em>voce media</em>
of which possessed an unequalled <em>aplomb</em>, whose deep double G must
still find a well-in-tune echo in the <em>tympanum</em> of every
<em>amateur</em> of taste. <em>That</em>, we must confess, as critics and
theoretical musicians, causes us considerable <em>embarras</em> for words
to describe. Who that heard it on Saturday last, has yet recovered the
ravishing sensation produced by the thrilling tremour with which Rubini
<em>gave</em> the <em>Notte d&rsquo;Orrore</em>, in Rossini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Marino Faliero?&rdquo; Who can forget the <em>recitativo con
andante et allegro</em>, in the last scene of &ldquo;La Sonnambula;&rdquo;
or the burst of anguish <em>con expressivissimo</em>, when accused of
treason, while personating his favourite <em>r&ocirc;le</em> in
&ldquo;Lucia di Lammermoor?&rdquo; Ah! those who suffered themselves to be
detained from the opera on Saturday last by mere illness, or other light
causes, will, to translate a forcible expression in the
&ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; of Dante, &ldquo;go down with sorrow to the
grave.&rdquo; To them we say, Rubini <em>est
parti</em>&mdash;gone!&mdash;he has sent forth his last
<em>ut</em>&mdash;concluded his last <em>re</em>&mdash;his ultimate note
has sounded&mdash;his last <em>billet de banque</em> is pocketed&mdash;he
has, to use an emphatic and heart-stirring <em>mot</em>,
&ldquo;<em>coup&eacute; son b&acirc;ton!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is due to the <em>sentimens</em> of the audience of Saturday, to
notice the evident regret with which they received Rubini&rsquo;s
<em>adieux</em>; for, towards the close of the evening, the secret became
known. Animated <em>conversazioni</em> resounded from almost every box
during many of his most charming <em>piano</em> passages (and never will
his <em>sotto-voce</em> be equalled)&mdash;the <em>beaux esprits</em> of
the pit discussed his merits with audible <em>go&ucirc;t</em>; while the
gallery and upper stalls remained in mute grief at the consciousness of
that being the <em>derni&egrave;re fois</em> they would ever be able to
hear the sublime <em>voce-di-testa</em> of Italy&rsquo;s prince of
<em>tenori</em>.</p>
<p>Although this retirement will make the present <em>cl&ocirc;ture</em>
of the opera one of the most memorable <em>&eacute;v&eacute;nemens</em> in
<em>les annales de l&rsquo;op&eacute;ra</em>, yet some remarks are
demanded of us upon the other <em>artistes</em>. In &ldquo;Marino
Faliero,&rdquo; Lablache came the <em>Dodge</em> with remarkable success.
Madlle. Loewe, far from deserving her <em>bas nom</em>, was the height of
perfection, and gave her celebrated <em>scena</em> in the last-named opera
<em>avec une force superbe</em>. Persiani looked remarkably well, and wore
a most becoming <em>robe</em> in the <em>r&ocirc;le</em> of Amina.</p>
<p>Of the <em>danseuses</em> we have hardly space to speak. Cerito
exhibited the &ldquo;poetry of motion&rdquo; with her usual skill,
particularly in a difficult <em>pas</em> with Albert. The ballet was
&ldquo;Le Diable Amoureux,&rdquo; and the stage was watered between each
act.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE GREAT UNACTABLES.</h3>
<p>It seems that the English Opera-house has been taken for <em>twelve
nights</em>, to give &ldquo;<em>a free stage and fair play</em>&rdquo; to
&ldquo;EVERY ENGLISH LIVING DRAMATIST.&rdquo; Considering that the Council
of the Dramatic Authors&rsquo; Theatre comprises at least half-a-dozen
Shakspeares in their own conceit, to say nothing of one or two
<em>Rowes</em> (soft ones of course), a sprinkling of Otways, with here
and there a Massinger, we may calculate pretty correctly how far the stage
they have taken possession of is likely to be <em>free</em>, or the
<em>play</em> to be <em>fair</em> towards <em>Every English living
Dramatist</em>.</p>
<p>It appears that a small knot of very great geniuses have been, for some
time past, regularly sending certain bundles of paper, called Dramas,
round to the different metropolitan theatres, and as regularly receiving
them back again. Some of these geniuses, goaded to madness by this
unceremonious treatment, have been guilty of the insanity of printing
their plays; and, though the &ldquo;Rejected Addresses&rdquo; were a very
good squib, the rejected Dramas are much too ponderous a joke for the
public to take; so that, while in their manuscript form, they always
produced speedy <em>returns</em> from the managers, they, in their printed
shape, caused no <em>returns</em> to the publishers. It is true, that a
personal acquaintance of some of the authors with Nokes of the <em>North
Eastern Independent</em>, or some other equally-influential country print,
may have gained for them, now and then, an egregious puff, wherein the
writers are said to be equal to Go&euml;the, a cut above Sheridan Knowles,
and the only successors of Shakspeare; but we suspect that &ldquo;the
mantle of the Elizabethan poets,&rdquo; which is said to have descended on
one of these gentry, would, if inspected, turn out to be something more
like Fitzball&rsquo;s Tagiioni or Dibdin Pitt&rsquo;s Macintosh.</p>
<p>No one can suspect PUNCH of any <em>prestige</em> in favour of the
restrictions laid upon the drama&mdash;for our own free-and-easy habit of
erecting our theatre in the first convenient street we come to, and going
through our performance without caring a rush for the Lord Chamberlain or
the Middlesex magistrates, must convince all who know us, that we are for
a thoroughly free trade in theatricals; but, nevertheless, we think the
<em>Great Unactables</em> talk egregious nonsense when they prate about
the possibility of their efforts working &ldquo;a beneficial alteration in
a law which presses so fatally on dramatic genius.&rdquo; We think their
tom-foolery more likely to induce restrictions that may prevent others
from exposing their mental imbecility, than to encourage the authorities
to relax the laws that might hinder them from doing so. The boasted
compliance with legal requisites in the mode of preparing
&ldquo;Martinuzzi&rdquo; for the stage is not a new idea, and we only hope
it may be carried out one-half as well as in the instances of &ldquo;Romeo
and Juliet as the Law directs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Othello according to Act
of Parliament.&rdquo; There is a vaster amount of humbug in the play-bill
of this new concern, than in all the open puffs that have been issued for
many years past from all the regular establishments. The tirade against
the <em>law</em>&mdash;the announcement of alterations in conformity with
<em>the law</em>&mdash;the hint that the musical introductions are such as
&ldquo;<em>the law</em> may require&rdquo;&mdash;mean nothing more than
this&mdash;&ldquo;if the piece is damned, it&rsquo;s <em>the law</em>; if
it succeeds, it&rsquo;s the <em>author&rsquo;s genius!</em>&rdquo; Now,
every one who has written for the illegitimate stage, and therefore PUNCH
in particular, knows very well that the necessity for the introduction of
music into a piece played at one of the smaller theatres is only
nominal&mdash;that four pieces of verse are interspersed in the copy sent
to the licenser, but these are such matters of utter course, that their
invention or selection is generally left to the prompter&rsquo;s genius.
The piece is, unless essentially musical, licensed with the songs and
acted without&mdash;or, at least, there is no necessity whatever for
retaining them. Why, therefore, should Mr. Stephens drag &ldquo;solos,
duets, choruses, and other musical arrangements,&rdquo; into his drama,
unless it is that he thinks they will give it a better chance of success?
while, in the event of failure, he reserves the right of turning round
upon the <em>law</em> and the <em>music</em>, which he will declare were
the means of damning it.</p>
<p>A set of briefless barristers&mdash;all would-be Erskines, Thurlows, or
Eldons, at the least&mdash;might as well complain of the system that
excludes them from the Woolsack, and take a building to turn it into a
Court of Chancery on their own account, as that these luckless scribblers,
all fancying the Elizabethan mantle has fallen flop upon their backs,
should set themselves up for Shakspeares on their own account, and seize
on a metropolitan theatre as a temple for the enshrinement of their
genius.</p>
<p>If PUNCH has dealt hardly with these gentlemen, it is because he will
bear &ldquo;no brother near the throne&rdquo; of humbug and quackery. Like
a steward who tricks his master, but keeps the rest of the servants
honest, PUNCH will gammon the public to the utmost of his skill, but he
will take care that no one else shall exercise a trade of which he claims
by prescription the entire monopoly.</p>
