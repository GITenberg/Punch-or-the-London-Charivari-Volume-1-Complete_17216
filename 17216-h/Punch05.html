<h3>A LEGEND OF MY UNCLE&rsquo;S BOOTS.</h3>
<h4><em>In Four Chapters.</em></h4>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="hide">H</span>aberdashers, continued my friend the boot,
are wonderful people; they make the greatest show out of the smallest
stock&mdash;whether of brains or ribbons&mdash;of any men in the world. A
stranger could not pass through the village of Ballybreesthawn without
being attracted by a shop which occupied the corner of the Market-square
and the main street, with a window looking both ways for custom. In these
windows were displayed sundry articles of use and ornament&mdash;toys,
stationery, perfumery, ribbons, laces, hardware, spectacles, and Dutch
dolls.</p>
<p>In a glass-case on the counter were exhibited patent medicines,
Birmingham jewellery, court-plaister, and side-combs. Behind the counter
might be seen Mr. Matthew Tibbins, quite a precedent for country
shop-keepers, with uncommonly fair hair and slender fingers, a profusion
of visible linen, and a most engaging lisp. In addition to his personal
attractions, Tibbins possessed a large stock of accomplishments, which,
like his goods, &ldquo;might safely challenge competition.&rdquo; He was
an acknowledged wit, and retailed compliments and cotton balls to the
young ladies who visited his emporium. As a poet, too, his merits were
universally known; for he had once contributed a poetic charade to the
<em>Ladies&rsquo; Almanack</em>. He, moreover, played delightfully on the
Jews&rsquo;-harp, knew several mysterious tricks in cards, and was an
adept in the science of bread and butter-cutting, which made him a
prodigious favourite with maiden aunts and side-table cousins. This was
the individual whom fate had ordained to cross and thwart Terence in his
designs upon the heart of Miss Biddy O&rsquo;Brannigan, and upon whom that
young lady, in sport or caprice, bestowed a large dividend of those smiles
which Terence imagined should be devoted solely to himself.</p>
<p>The man of small wares was, in truth, a dangerous rival, from his very
insignificance. Had he been a man of spirit or corporal consideration,
Terence would have pistolled or thrashed him out of his audacious notions;
but the creature was so smiling and submissive that he could not, for the
life of him, dirty his fingers with such a contemptible wretch. Thus
Tibbins continued flattering and wriggling himself into Miss Biddy&rsquo;s
good graces, while Terence was fighting and kissing the way to her heart,
till the poor girl was fairly bothered between them.</p>
<p>Miss Biddy O&rsquo;Brannigan, I should have told you, sir, was an
heiress, valued at one thousand pounds in hard cash, living with an old
aunt at Rookawn Lodge, about six miles from Ballybreesthawn; and to this
retreat of the loves and graces might the rival lovers be seen directing
their course, after mass, every Sunday;&mdash;the haberdasher in a green
gig with red wheels, and your uncle mounted on a bit of blood, taking the
coal off Tibbins&rsquo;s pipe with the impudence of his air, and the
elegant polish of your humble servants.</p>
<p>Matters went on in this way for some time&mdash;Miss O&rsquo;Brannigan
not having declared in favour of either of her suitors&mdash;when one
bitter cold evening, I remember it was in the middle of January, we were
whipped off our peg in the hall, and in company with our fellow-labourers,
the buckskin continuations, were carried up to your uncle, whom we found
busily preparing for a ball, which was to be given that night by the
heiress of Rookawn Lodge. I confess that my brother and myself felt a
strong presentiment that something unfortunate would occur, and our
forebodings were shared by the buckskins, who, like ourselves, felt
considerable reluctance to join in the expedition. Remonstrance, however,
would have been idle; we therefore submitted with the best grace we could,
and in a few minutes were bestriding Terence&rsquo;s favourite hunter, and
crossing the country over ditch, dyke, and drain, as if we were tallying
at the tail of a fox. The night was dark, and a recent fall of rain had so
swollen a mountain stream which lay in our road, that when we reached the
ford, which was generally passable by foot passengers, Terence was obliged
to swim his horse across, and to dismount on the opposite side, in order
to assist the animal up a steep clayey bank which had been formed by the
torrent undermining and cutting away the old banks.</p>
<p>Although we had received no material damage, you may suppose that our
appearance was not much improved by the water and yellow clay into which
we had been plunged; and had it been possible, we would have blushed with
vexation, on finding ourselves introduced by Terence in a very unseemly
state, amidst the titters of a number of young people, into the ball-room
at Rookawn Lodge. However, we became somewhat reassured, when we heard the
droll manner in which he related his swim, with such ornamental flourishes
and romantic embellishments as made him an object of general interest
during the night.</p>
<p>Matthew Tibbins had already taken the field in a blue satin waistcoat
and nankeen trousers. At the instant we entered the dancing-room, he had
commenced lisping to Miss Biddy, in a tender love-subdued tone, a couplet
which he had committed to memory for the occasion, when a glance of
terrible meaning from Terence&rsquo;s eye met his&mdash;the unfinished
stanza died in his throat, and without waiting the nearer encounter of his
dreaded rival, he retreated to a distant corner of the apartment, leaving
to Terence the post of honour beside the heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Duffy,&rdquo; said she, accompanying her words with the
blandest smile you can conceive, as he approached, &ldquo;what a wonderful
escape you have had. Dear me! I declare you are dripping wet. Will you not
change your&mdash;clothes?&rdquo; and Miss Biddy glanced furtively at the
buckskins, which, like ourselves, had got thoroughly soaked. &ldquo;Oh! by
no means, my dear Miss Biddy,&rdquo; replied Terence, gaily;
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis only a thrifle of water&mdash;that won&rsquo;t hurt
them&rdquo;&mdash;and then added, in a confidential tone,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;d go through fire as well as water for
one kind look from those deludin&rsquo; eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame, Mr. Duffy! how can you!&rdquo; responded Miss Biddy,
putting her handkerchief to her face to make believe she blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the blessed truth&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you know
it is, you darling?&mdash;Oh! Miss Biddy, I&rsquo;m wasting away like a
farthing candle in the dog-days&mdash;I&rsquo;m going down to my snug
grave through your cruelty. The daisies will be growing over me afore next
Easther&mdash;Ugh&mdash;ugh&mdash;ugh. I&rsquo;ve a murderin&rsquo; cough
too, and nothing can give me ase but yourself, Miss Biddy,&rdquo; cried
Terence eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! they&rsquo;ll hear you,&rdquo; said the heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who hears me,&rdquo; replied Terence
desperately; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand dying by inches this way.
I&rsquo;ll destroy myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Terence!&rdquo; murmured Miss O&rsquo;Brannigan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued: &ldquo;I loaded my pistols this
morning, and I told Barney M&rsquo;Guire, the dog-feeder, to come over and
shoot me the first thing he does in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terence, <em>dear</em>, what do you want? What am I to
say?&rdquo; inquired the trembling girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; cried Terence, who was resolved to clinch the
business at a word; &ldquo;say that you love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The handkerchief was again applied to Miss O&rsquo;Brannigan&rsquo;s
face, and a faint affirmative issued from the depths of the cambric.
Terence&rsquo;s heart hopped like a racket-ball in his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand upon it,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Miss Biddy placed the envied <em>palm</em>, not on his brows, but in
his hand, and was led by him to the top of a set which was forming for a
country dance, from whence they started off at the rate of one of our
modern steam-engines, to the spirit-stirring tune of &ldquo;Haste to the
Wedding.&rdquo; There was none of the pirouetting, and chassez-ing, and
balancez-ing, of your slip-shod quadrilles in vogue then&mdash;it was all
life and action: swing corners in a hand gallop, turn your partner in a
whirlwind, and down the middle like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>Terence had never acquitted himself so well; he cut, capered, and set
to his partner with unusual agility; <em>we</em> naturally participated in
the admiration he excited, and in the fullness of our triumph, while
brushing past the flimsy nankeens worn by Tibbins, I could not refrain
from bestowing a smart kick upon his shins, that brought the tears to his
eyes with pain and vexation.</p>
<p>After the dance had concluded, Terence led his glowing partner to a
cool quiet corner, where leaving her, he flew to the side table, and in
less time than he would take to bring down a snipe, he was again beside
her with a large mugful of hot negus, into which he had put, by way of
stiffener, a copious dash of mountain dew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like it, my darling?&rdquo; asked Terence, after Miss
Biddy had read the maker&rsquo;s name in the bottom of the mug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too strong, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; replied the heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong! Wake as <em>tay</em>, upon my honour! Miss Biddy,&rdquo;
cried Mr. Duffy.</p>
<p>(The result of Terence Duffy&rsquo;s courtship will be given in the
next chapter).</p>

<h3>LADY MORGAN&rsquo;S LITTLE ONE.</h3>
<p>Her ladyship, at her last <em>conversazione</em>, propounded to PUNCH
the following classical poser:&mdash;&ldquo;How would you translate the
Latin words, <em>puella</em>, <em>defectus</em>, <em>puteus</em>,
<em>dies</em>, into four English interjections?&rdquo; Our wooden Roscius
hammered his pate for full five minutes, and then
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;A-lass! a-lack! a-well a-day!&rdquo; Her ladyship
protested that the answer would have done honour to the professor of
languages at the London University.</p>

<h2>THE ROYAL LION AND UNICORN.</h2>
<h3>A DIALOGUE.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;GROUND ARMS!&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Birdcage Walk.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>LION.&mdash;So! how do you feel now?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Considerably relieved. Though you can&rsquo;t imagine
the stiffness of my neck and legs. Let me see, how long is it since we
relieved the griffins?</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;An odd century or two, but never mind that. For the first
time, we have laid down our charge&mdash;have got out of our state
attitudes, and may sit over our pot and pipe at ease.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;What a fate is ours! Here have we, in our time, been
compelled to give the patronage of our countenance to all sorts of
rascality&mdash;have been forced to support robbery, swindling,
extortion&mdash;but it won&rsquo;t do to think of&mdash;give me the pot.
Oh! dear, it had suited better with my conscience, had I been doomed to
draw a sand-cart!</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Come, come, no unseemly affectation. <em>You</em>, at the
best, are only a fiction&mdash;a quadruped lie.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;I know naturalists dispute my existence, but if, as you
unkindly say, I am only a fiction, why should I have been selected as a
supporter of the royal arms?</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Why, you fool, for that very reason. Have you been where
you are for so many years, and yet don&rsquo;t know that often, in state
matters, the greater the lie the greater the support?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Right. When I reflect&mdash;I have greater doubts of my
truth, seeing where I am.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;But here am I, in myself a positive majesty, degraded into
a petty-larceny scoundrel; yes, all my inherent attributes compromised by
my position. Oh, Hercules! when I remember my native Africa&mdash;when I
reflect on the sweet intoxication of my former liberty&mdash;the
excitement of the chase&mdash;the mad triumph of my spring, cracking the
back of a bison with one fillip of my paw&mdash;when I think of these
things&mdash;of my tawny wife with her smile sweetly ferocious, her breath
balmy with new blood&mdash;of my playful little ones, with eyes of topaz
and claws of pearl&mdash;when I think of all this, and feel that here I
am, a damned rabbit-sucker&mdash;</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t swear.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Why not? God knows, we&rsquo;ve heard swearing enough of
all sorts in our time. It isn&rsquo;t the fault of our position, if
we&rsquo;re not first-rate perjurers.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;That&rsquo;s true: still, though we are compelled to
witness all these things in the courts of law, let us be above the
influence of bad example.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Give me the pot. Courts of law? Oh, Lord! what places they
put us into! And there they expect me&mdash;<em>me</em>, the king of the
animal world, to stand quietly upon my two hind-legs, looking as mildly
contemptible as an apoplectic dancing-master,&mdash;whilst iniquities, and
meannesses, and tyranny, and&mdash;give me the pot.</p>
<p>UNICORN:&mdash;Brother, you&rsquo;re getting warm. Really, you ought to
have seen enough of state and justice to take everything coolly. I
certainly must confess that&mdash;looking at much of the policy of the
country, considering much of the legal wickedness of law-scourged
England&mdash;it does appear to me a studied insult to both of us to make
us supporters of the national quarterings. Surely, considering the things
that have been done under our noses, animals more significant of the state
and social policy might have been promoted to our places. Instead of the
majestic lion and the graceful unicorn, might they not have had
the&mdash;the&mdash;</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;The vulture and the magpie.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Excellent! The vulture would have capitally typified
many of the wars of the state, their sole purpose being so many
carcases&mdash;whilst, for the courts of law, the magpie would have been
the very bird of legal justice and legal wisdom.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Yes, but then the very rascality of their faces would at
once have declared their purpose. The vulture is a filthy, unclean
wretch&mdash;the bird of Mars&mdash;preying upon the eyes, the hearts, the
entrails of the victims of that scoundrel-mountebank, Glory; whilst the
magpie is a petty-larceny vagabond, existing upon social theft. To use a
vulgar phrase&mdash;and considering the magistrates we are compelled to
keep company with, &rsquo;tis wonderful that we talk so purely as we
do&mdash;&rsquo;twould have let the cat too much out of the bag to have
put the birds where we stand. Whereas, there is a fine hypocrisy about us.
Consider&mdash;am not I the type of heroism, of magnanimity? Well,
compelling me, the heroic, the magnanimous, now to stand here upon my
hind-legs, and now to crouch quietly down, like a pet kitten over-fed with
new milk,&mdash;any state roguery is passed off as the greatest piece of
single-minded honesty upon the mere strength of my character&mdash;if I
may so say it, upon my legendary reputation. Now, as for you, though you
<em>are</em> a lie, you are nevertheless not a bad-looking lie. You have a
nice head, clean legs, and&mdash;though I think it a little impertinent
that you should wear that tuft at the end of your tail&mdash;are
altogether a very decent mixture of the quadrupeds. Besides, lie or not,
you have helped to support the national arms so long, that depend upon it
there are tens of thousands who believe you to be a true thing.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;I have often flattered myself with that consolation.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;A poor comfort: for if you are a true beast, and really
have the attributes you are painted with, the greater the insult that you
should be placed here. If, on the contrary, you are a lie, still greater
the insult to leonine majesty, in forcing me for so many, many years to
keep such bad company.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;But I have a great belief in my reality: besides, if the
head, body, legs, tail, I bear, never really met in one animal, they all
exist in several: hence, if I am not true altogether, I am true in parts;
and what would you have of a thick-and-thin supporter of the crown?</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Blush, brother, blush; such sophistry is only worthy of the
Common Pleas, where I know you picked it up. To be sure, if both of us
were the most abandoned of beasts, we surely should have some excuse for
our wickedness in the profligate company we are obliged to keep.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Well, well, don&rsquo;t weep. <em>Take</em> the pot.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Have we not been, ay, for hundreds of years, in both Houses
of Parliament?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;It can&rsquo;t be denied.</p>
<p>LION&mdash;And there, what have we not seen&mdash;what have we not
heard! What brazen, unblushing faces! What cringing, and bowing, and
fawning! What scoundrel smiles, what ruffian frowns! what polished lying!
What hypocrisy of patriotism! What philippics, levelled in the very name
of liberty, against her sacred self! What orations on the benefit of
starvation&mdash;on the comeliness of rags! Have we not heard selfishness
speaking with a syren voice? Have we not seen the haggard face of
state-craft rouged up into a look of pleasantness and innocence? Have we
not, night after night, seen the national Jonathan Wilds meet to plan a
robbery, and&mdash;the purse taken&mdash;have they not rolled in their
carriages home, with their fingers smelling of the people&rsquo;s
pockets?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;It&rsquo;s true&mdash;true as an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Then are we not obliged to be in the Courts of Law? In
Chancery&mdash;to see the golden wheat of the honest man locked in the
granaries of equity&mdash;granaries where deepest rats do most
abound&mdash;whilst the slow fire of famine shall eat the vitals of the
despoiled; and it may be the man of rightful thousands shall be carried to
churchyard clay in parish deals? Then in the Bench, in the
Pleas&mdash;there we are too. And there, see we not justice weighing
cobwebs against truth, making too often truth herself kick the beam?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;It has made me mad to see it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
<p>LION.&mdash;Turn we to the Police-offices&mdash;there we are again. And
there&mdash;good God!&mdash;to see the arrogance of ignorance! To listen
to the vapid joke of his worship on the crime of beggary! To see the
punishment of the poor&mdash;to mark the sweet impunity of the rich! And
then are we not in the Old Bailey&mdash;in all the criminal courts! Have
we not seen trials <em>after dinner</em>&mdash;have we not heard sentences
in which the bottle spoke more than the judge?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Come, come, no libel on the ermine.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;The ermine! In such cases, the fox&mdash;the pole-cat. Have
we not seen how the state makes felons, and then punishes them for
evil-doing?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;We certainly have seen a good deal that way.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;And then the motto we are obliged to look grave over!</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;What <em>Dieu et mon droit!</em> Yes, that does
sometimes come awkwardly in&mdash;&ldquo;God and my right!&rdquo; Seeing
what is sometimes done under our noses, now and then, I can hardly hold my
countenance.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;&ldquo;God and my right!&rdquo; What atrocity has that
legend sanctified! and yet with demure faces they try men for blasphemy.
Give me the pot.</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Come, be cool&mdash;be philosophic. I tell you we shall
have as much need as ever of our stoicism?</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter now?</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;The matter! Why, the Tories are to be in, and
Peel&rsquo;s to be minister.</p>
<p>LION.&mdash;Then he may send for Mr. Cross for the oran-outan to take
my place, for never again do I support <em>him</em>. Peel minister, and
Goulburn, I suppose&mdash;</p>
<p>UNICORN.&mdash;Goulburn! Goulburn in the cabinet! If it be so, I shall
certainly vacate my place in favour of a jackass.</p>

<h2>UNIVERSITY OF LONDON.</h2>
<h3>BACHELOR OF MEDICINE&mdash;FIRST EXAMINATION, 1841.</h3>
<p>The first examination for the degree of bachelor of medicine has taken
place at the London University, and has raised itself to the level of
Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Without doubt, it will soon acquire all the other attributes of the
colleges. Town and gown rows will cause perpetual confusion to the
steady-going inhabitants of Euston-square: steeple-chases will be run, for
the express delight of the members, on the waste grounds in the vicinity
of the tall chimneys on the Birmingham railroad; and in all probability,
the whole of Gower-street, from Bedford-square to the New-road, will, at a
period not far distant, be turfed and formed into a T.Y.C.; the property
securing its title-deeds under the arms of the university for the benefit
of its legs&mdash;the bar opposite the hospital presenting a fine leap to
finish the contest over, with the uncommon advantage of immediate medical
assistance at hand.</p>
<p>The public press of the last week has duly blazoned forth the names of
the successful candidates, and great must have been the rejoicings of
their friends in the country at the event. But we have to quarrel with
these journals for not more explicitly defining the questions proposed for
the examinations&mdash;the answers to which were to be considered the
tests of proficiency. By means of the ubiquity which Punch is allowed to
possess, we were stationed in the examination room, at the same time that
our double was delighting a crowded and highly respectable audience upon
Tower-hill; and we have the unbounded gratification of offering an exact
copy of the questions to our readers, that they may see with delight how
high a position medical knowledge has attained in our country:&mdash;</p>
<h3>SELECTIONS FROM THE EXAMINATION PAPERS.</h3>
<h4>ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>State the principal variations found in the kidneys procured at
Evans&rsquo;s and the Coal Hole; and likewise name the proportion of
animal fibre in the rump-steaks of the above resorts. Mention, likewise,
the change produced in the <em>albumen</em>, or white of an egg, by
poaching it upon toast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the comparative circulation of blood in the body, and of the
<em>Lancet, Medical Gazette</em>, and <em>Bell&rsquo;s Life in
London</em>, in the hospitals; and mention if Sir Charles Bell, the author
of the &ldquo;Bridgewater Treatise on the Hand,&rdquo; is the editor of
the last-named paper.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>MEDICINE.</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are called to a fellow-student taken suddenly ill. You find him
lying on his back in the fender; his eyes open, his pulse full, and his
breathing stertorous. His mind appears hysterically wandering, prompting
various windmill-like motions of his arms, and an accompanying lyrical
intimation that he, and certain imaginary friends, have no intention of
going home until the appearance of day-break. State the probable disease;
and also what pathological change would be likely to be effected by
putting his head under the cock of the cistern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the Mount Hecla at the Surrey Zoological Gardens classed by Bateman
in his work upon skin diseases&mdash;if so, what kind of eruption did it
come under? Where was the greatest irritation produced&mdash;in the
scaffold-work of the erection, or the bosom of the gentleman who lived
next to the gardens, and had a private exhibition of rockets every night,
as they fell through his skylight, and burst upon the stairs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is the most powerful narcotic&mdash;opium, henbane, or a lecture
upon practice of physic; and will a moderate dose of antimonial wine sweat
a man as much as an examination at Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>CHEMISTRY AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does any chemical combination take place between the porter and ale in
a pot of half-and-half upon mixture? Is there a galvanic current set up
between the pewter and the beer capable of destroying the equilibrium of
living bodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the philosophical meaning of the sentence&mdash;&ldquo;He cut
away from the crushers as quick as a flash of lightning through a
gooseberry-bush.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two kinds of electricity, positive and negative; and these
have a pugnacious tendency. <em>A</em>, a student, goes up to the College
<em>positive</em> he shall pass; <em>B</em>, an examiner, thinks his
abilities <em>negative</em>, and flummuxes him accordingly. <em>A</em>
afterwards meets <em>B</em> alone, in a retired spot, where there is no
policeman, and, to use his own expression, &ldquo;takes out the
change&rdquo; upon <em>B</em>. In this case, which receives the greatest
shock&mdash;<em>A</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;grinder,&rdquo; at hearing his pupil
was plucked, or <em>B</em> for doing it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more crowded an assembly is, the greater quantity of carbonic acid
is evolved by its component members. State, upon actual experience, the
<em>per centage</em> of this gas in the atmosphere of the following
places:&mdash;The Concerts d&rsquo;Et&eacute;, the Swan in Hungerford
Market, the pit of the Adelphi, Hunt&rsquo;s Billiard Rooms, and the
Colosseum during the period of its balls.</p>
</li>

<h3>HARVEST PROSPECTS.</h3>
<p>Public attention being at this particular season anxiously directed to
the prospects of the approaching harvest, we are enabled to lay before our
readers some authentic information on the subject. Notwithstanding the
fears which the late unfavourable weather induced, we have ascertained
that reaping is proceeding vigorously at all the barbers&rsquo;
establishments in the kingdom. Several extensive chins were cut on
Saturday last, and the returns proved most abundant.</p>
<p>Sugar-barley is a comparative failure; but that description of oats,
called wild oats, promises well in the neighbourhood of Oxford.
<em>Turn-ups</em> have had a favourable season at the &eacute;cart&eacute;
tables of several dowagers in the West-end district. Beans are looking
poorly&mdash;particularly the <em>have-beens</em>&mdash;whom we meet with
seedy frocks and napless hats, gliding about late in the evenings. Clover,
we are informed by some luxurious old codgers, who are living in the midst
of it, was never in better condition. The best description of hops, it is
thought, will fetch high prices in the Haymarket. The vegetation of wheat
has been considerably retarded by the cold weather. Sportsmen, however,
began to shoot vigorously on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>All things considered, though we cannot anticipate a rich harvest, we
think that the speculators have exaggerated the</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</h2>
<h5>(IN HUMBLE IMITATION OF THE AUTHOR OF &ldquo;THE GREAT
METROPOLIS.&rdquo;)</h5>
<h3>No. I.&mdash;THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</h3>
<p>Before entering on this series of papers, I have only one request to
make of the reader, which is this: that, however absurd or incredible my
statements may appear, he will take them all for <em>Grant</em>-ed.</p>
<p>It will hardly be necessary to apologise for making the hero of
Waterloo the subject of this article; for, having had always free access
to the parlour of the Duke of Wellington, I flatter myself that I am
peculiarly fitted for the task I have undertaken.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with the duke commenced in a very singular manner.
During the discussions on the Reform Bill, his grace was often the object
of popular pelting; and I was, on one occasion, among a crowd of free-born
Englishmen who, disliking his political opinions, were exercising the
constitutional privilege of hooting him. Fired by the true spirit of
British patriotism, and roused to a pitch of enthusiasm by observing that
the crowd were all of one opinion, decidedly against the duke, worked up,
too, with momentary boldness by perceiving that there was not a policeman
in sight, I seized a cabbage-leaf, with which I caught his nose, when,
turning round suddenly to look whence the blow proceeded, I caught his
eye. It was a single glance; but there was something in it which said more
than, perhaps, if I had attempted to lead him into conversation, he would
at that moment have been inclined to say to me. The recognition was brief,
lasting scarcely an instant; for a policeman coming round the corner, the
great constitutional party with whom I had been acting retired in haste,
rather than bring on a collision with a force which was at that time
particularly obnoxious to all the true friends of excessive liberty.</p>
<p>It will, perhaps, surprise my readers, when I inform them that this is
the only personal interview I ever enjoyed with the illustrious duke; but
accustomed as I am to take in character at a glance, and to form my
conclusions at a wink, I gained, perhaps, as much, or more, information
with regard to the illustrious hero, as I have been enabled to do with
regard to many of those members of the House of Lords whom, in the course
of my &ldquo;Random Recollections,&rdquo; it is my intention to treat
of.</p>
<p>I never, positively, dined with the Duke of Wellington; but on one
occasion I was very near doing so. Whether the duke himself is aware of
the circumstances that prevented our meeting at the same table I never
knew, and have no wish to inquire; but when his grace peruses these pages,
he will perceive that our political views are not so opposite as the
<em>dastardly enemies</em> of both would have made the world suppose them
to have been. The story of the dinner is simply this:&mdash;there was to
be a meeting for the purpose of some charity at the
Freemasons&rsquo;-hall, and the Duke of Wellington was to take the chair.
I was offered a ticket by a friend connected with the press. My friend
broke his word. I did not attend the dinner. But those virulent liars much
malign me who say I stopped away because the duke was in the chair; and
much more do they libel me who would hint that my absence was caused by a
difference with the duke on the subject of politics. Whether Wellington
observed that I did not attend I never knew, nor shall I stop to inquire;
but when I say that his grace spoke several times, and never once
mentioned my name, it will be seen that whatever may have been his
<em>thoughts</em> on the occasion, he had the delicacy and good taste to
make no allusion whatever to the subject, which, but for its intrinsic
importance, I should not so long have dwelt upon,</p>
<p>Looking over some papers the other day in my drawer, with the intention
of selecting any correspondence that might have passed between myself and
the duke, I found that his grace had never written to me more than once;
but the single communication I had received from him was so truly
characteristic of the man, that I cannot refrain from giving the whole of
it. Having heard it reported that the duke answered with his own hand
every letter that he received, I, who generally prefer judging in all
things for myself, determined to put his grace&rsquo;s epistolary
punctuality to the test of experience. With this view I took up my pen,
and dashed off a few lines, in which I made no allusion, either to my
first interview, or the affair of the dinner; but simply putting forward a
few general observations on the state of the country, signed with my own
name, and dated from Whetstone-park, which was, at that time, my
residence. The following was the reply I received from the duke, which I
print <em>verbatim</em>, as an index&mdash;short, but comprehensive, as an
index ought to be&mdash;to the noble duke&rsquo;s character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;">&ldquo;Apsley-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Wellington begs to return the enclosed letter, as he
neither knows the person who wrote it, nor the reason of sending
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, as I said before, is perhaps one of the most graphic
<em>traits</em> on record of the peculiar disposition of the hero of
Waterloo. It bespeaks at once the soldier and the politician. He answers
the letter with military precision, but with political astuteness&mdash;he
pretends to be ignorant of the object I had in sending it. His ready reply
was the first impulse of the man; his crafty and guarded mode of
expression was the cautious act of the minister. Had I been disposed to
have written a second time to my illustrious correspondent, I now had a
fine opportunity of doing so; but I preferred letting the matter drop, and
from that day to this, all communication between myself and the duke has
ceased. <em>I</em> shall not be the first to take any step for the purpose
of resuming it. The duke must, by this time, know me too well to suppose
that I have any desire to keep up a correspondence which could lead to no
practical result, and might only tear open afresh wounds that the healing
hand of time has long ago restored to their former salubrity.</p>
<p>It may be expected I should say a few words of the duke&rsquo;s person.
He generally wears a frock coat, and rides frequently on horseback. His
nose is slightly curved; but there is nothing peculiar in his hat or
boots, the latter of which are, of course, Wellington&rsquo;s. His habits
are still those of a soldier, for he gets up and goes to bed again much as
he was accustomed to do in the days of the Peninsula. His speeches in
Parliament I have never heard; but I have read some of them in the
newspapers. He is now getting old; but I cannot tell his exact age: and he
has a son who, if he should survive his father, will undoubtedly attain to
the title of Duke of Wellington.</p>

<h3>EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION.</h3>
<h4><em>Royal Dispensary for Diseases of the Ear</em>.</h4>
<p>Our esteemed friend and staunch supporter Colonel Sibthorp has lately,
in the most heroic manner, submitted to an unprecedented and wonderfully
successful operation. Our gallant friend was suffering from a severe
elongation of the auricular organs; amputation was proposed, and submitted
to with most heroic patience. We are happy to state the only inconvenience
resulting from the operation is the establishment of a new hat block, and
a slight difficulty of recognition on the part of some of his oldest
friends.</p>

<h3>EXTRAORDINARY ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>One of the morning papers gave its readers last week a piece of
extraordinary assize intelligence, headed&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Cutting a
wife&rsquo;s throat&mdash;before Mr. Serjeant Taddy</em>&rdquo; We advise
the learned Serjeant to look to this: &rsquo;tis a too serious joke to be
set down as an accessary to the cutting of a wife&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<h3>ALARMING DESTITUTION.</h3>
<p>In the parish of Llanelly, Breconshire, the males exceed the females by
more than one thousand. At Worcester, says the <em>Examiner</em>, the same
majority is in favour of the ladies. We should propose a conference and a
general swap of the sexes next market-day, as we understand there is not a
window in Worcester without a notice of &ldquo;Lodgings to let for single
men,&rdquo; whilst at Llanelly the gentlemen declare sweethearts
can&rsquo;t be had for &ldquo;love nor money.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE TORY TABLE D&rsquo;HOTE&mdash;BILLY HOLMES
(<em>loquitur</em>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Walk up, walk up, ladies and gentlemen, feeding is going to
commence Wellington and Peel are now giving their opening dinners to their
friends and admirers. All who want <em>places</em> must come early. Walk
up! walk up!&mdash;This is the real constitutional tavern. Here we are!
gratis feeding for the greedy! Make way there for those hungry-looking
gentlemen&mdash;walk up, sir&mdash;leave your vote at the bar, and take a

<p>The Tories vow the Whigs are black as night,</p>

<h3>THE LEGAL ECCALOBEION.</h3>
<p>Baron Campbell, who has sat altogether about 20 hours in the Irish
Court of Chancery, will receive 4,000<em>l</em>. a-year, on the death of
either Lord Manners or Lord Plunkett, (both octogenarians;) which, says
the <em>Dublin Monitor</em>, &ldquo;taking the average of human life, he
will enjoy thirty years;&rdquo; and adds, &ldquo;20 hours contain 1,200
minutes; and 4,000<em>l</em>. a-year for thirty years gives
120,000<em>l</em>. So that he will receive for the term of his natural
life just one hundred pounds for every minute that he sat as Lord
Chancellor.&rdquo; Pleasant incubation this! Sitting 20 hours, and
hatching a fortune. If there be any truth in metempsychosis, Jocky
Campbell must be the <em>goose that laid golden eggs</em>.</p>

<h3>CALUMNY REFUTED.</h3>
<p>We can state on the most positive authority that the recent fire at the
Army and Navy Club did not originate from a spark of Colonel
Sibthorp&rsquo;s wit falling amongst some loose jokes which Captain
Marryatt had been scribbling on the backs of some unedited purser&rsquo;s
bills.</p>

<h3>A MATTER OF TASTE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Do you admire Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pleasures of
Hope&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Croker to Hook. &ldquo;Which do you mean, the
Scotch poet&rsquo;s or the Irish Chancellor&rsquo;s? the real or the
ideal&mdash;Tommy&rsquo;s four thousand lines or Jocky&rsquo;s four
thousand pounds a-year?&rdquo; inquired Theodore. Croker has been in a
brown study ever since.</p>

<h3>CHARLES KEAN&rsquo;S &ldquo;CHEEK.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Myself and a few other old Etonians have read with
inexpressible scorn, disgust, and indignation, the heartless and malignant
attempts, in your scoundrel journal, to blast the full-blown fame of that
most transcendant actor, and most unexceptionable son, Mr. Charles Kean.
Now, PUNCH, fair play is beyond any of the crown jewels. I will advance
only one proof, amongst a thousand others that cart-horses
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t draw from me, to show that Charles Kean makes
more&mdash;mind, I say, makes <em>more</em>&mdash;of Shakspere, than every
other actor living or dead. Last night I went to the Haymarket&mdash;Lady
Georgiana L&mdash;&mdash; and other fine girls were of the party. The play
was &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; and there are in that tragedy two
slap-up lines; they are, to the best of my recollection, as
follow:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh!</em> that I were a glove upon that hand,</p>
<p>That I might touch that <em>cheek</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, ninety-nine actors out of a hundred make nothing of this&mdash;not
so Charles Kean. Here&rsquo;s my proof. Feeling devilish hungry, I thought
I&rsquo;d step out for a snack, and left the box, just as Charles Kean, my
old schoolfellow, was beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Well, I crossed the way, stepped into Dubourg&rsquo;s, swallowed two
dozen oysters, took a bottom of brandy, and booked a small bet with Jack
Spavin for the St. Leger, returned to the theatre, and was comfortably
seated in my box, as Charles Kean, my old school-fellow, had arrived
at</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;cheek!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, PUNCH, if this isn&rsquo;t making much of Shakspere, what is?</p>
<p>Yours (you scoundrel),<br />
ETONIAN.</p>

<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;Balaam, blow the trumpet.</p>
<p>BALAAM (<em>blows</em>).&mdash;Too-too-tooit! Silence for the
doctor!</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;Now, friends and neighbours, now&rsquo;s your time
for getting rid of all your complaints, whether of the pocket or the
person, for I, Rhubarb Pill, professor of sophistry and doctorer of laws,
have now come amongst you with my old and infallible remedies and
restoratives, which, although they have not already worked wonders, I
promise shall do so, and render the constitution sound and vigorous,
however it may have been injured by poor-law-bill-ious pills, cheap bread,
and <em>black</em> sugar, prescribed by wooden-headed quacks.
(<em>Aside</em>.) Balaam, blow the trumpet.</p>
<p>BALAAM (<em>blows</em>).&mdash;Too-too-tooit! Hurrah for the
doctor!</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;These infallible remedies have been in my
possession since the years 1835 and 1837, but owing to the opposition of
the Cabinet of Physicians, I have not been able to use them for the
benefit of the public&mdash;and myself. (<em>Bows</em>.) These invaluable
remedies&mdash;</p>
<p>COUNTRYMAN.&mdash;What be they?</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;That&rsquo;s not a fair question&mdash;<em>wait
till I&rsquo;m regularly called in</em><sup>1</sup><span class=

care about the fee&mdash;mine is a liberal profession, and though I have a
large family, and as many relations as most people, I really think I
should refuse a guinea if it was offered to me.</p>
<p>COUNTRYMAN.&mdash;Then why doant&rsquo;ee tell us?</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;It&rsquo;s not professional. Besides, it&rsquo;s
quite requisite that I should &ldquo;<em>feel the patient&rsquo;s
pulse</em>,&rdquo; or I might make the dose too powerful, and
so&mdash;</p>

<p>BALAAM.&mdash;Too-too-tooit&mdash;tooit-too-too!</p>

require to have the &ldquo;<em>necessary consultations</em>&rdquo; over
the dinner-table. Diet does a great deal&mdash;not that I care about the
&ldquo;loaves and fishes&rdquo;&mdash;but patients are always more
tractable after a good dinner. Now there&rsquo;s an old lady in these
parts&mdash;</p>
<p>COUNTRYMAN.&mdash;What, my old missus?</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;The same. She&rsquo;s in a desperate way.</p>
<p>COUNTRYMAN.&mdash;Ees. Dr. Russell says it&rsquo;s all owing to your
nasty nosdrums.</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;Doctor Russell&rsquo;s a&mdash;never mind. I say
she <em>is</em> very bad, and I AM the only man that can cure her.</p>

<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;<em>Wait till I&rsquo;m regularly called
in.</em></p>
<p>COUNTRYMAN.&mdash;But suppose she dies in the meantime?</p>
<p>RHUBARB PILL.&mdash;That&rsquo;s her fault. I won&rsquo;t do anything
by proxy. I must direct my own <em>administration</em>, appoint my own
nurses for the bed-chamber, have my own herbalists and assistants, and see
Doctor Russell&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>purge</em>&rdquo; thrown out of the
window. In short, <em>I must be regularly called in</em>. Balaam, blow the

<p>Alas! that poor old Whiggery should have been so silly as to go
a-wooing. Infirm and tottering as he is, it was the height of insanity.
Down he dropped on his bended knees before the object of his love; out he
poured his touching addresses, lisped in the blandest, most persuasive

Johnny Russell&rsquo;s muse availed not, though it deserved a better fate.

<h2>NURSERY EDUCATION REPORT.</h2>
<p>As much anxiety necessarily exists for the future well-being of our
beloved infant Princess, we have determined to take upon ourselves the
onerous duties of her education. In accordance with the taste of her Royal
mother for that soft language which</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;sounds as if it should be writ on satin,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>we have commenced by translating the old nursery song of &ldquo;Ride a
cock-horse&rdquo; into most choice Italian, and have had it set to music
by Rossini; who, we are happy to state, has performed his task entirely to
the satisfaction of Mrs. Ratsey, the nurse of her Royal Highness; a lady
equally anxious with ourselves to instil into the infant mind an utter
contempt for everything English, except those effigies of her illustrious
mother which emanate from the Mint. The original of this exquisite and
simple ballad is too well known to need a transcript; the Italian version,
we doubt not, will become equally popular with aristocratic mamas and
fashionable nurses.</p>

<h2>PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON PHRENOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES.</h2>
<p>Mr. Combe, the great phrenologist, or, as some call him, Mr.
<em>Comb</em>&mdash;perhaps on account of his being so busy about the
head&mdash;has given it as his opinion, that in less than a hundred years
public affairs will be (in America at least) carried on by the rules of
phrenology. By postponing the proof of his assertion for a century, he
seems determined that no one shall ever give him the lie while living, and
when dead it will, of course, be of no consequence. We are inclined to
think there may be some truth in the anticipation, and we therefore throw
out a few hints as to how the science ought to be applied, if posterity
should ever agree on making practical use of it. Ministers of state must
undoubtedly be chosen according to their bumps, and of course, therefore,
no chancellor or any other legal functionary will be selected who has the
smallest symptom of the bump of <em>benevolence</em>. The judges must
possess <em>causality</em> in a very high degree; and <em>time</em>, which
gives rise to <em>the perception of duration</em> (which they could apply
to Chancery suits), would be a great qualification for a Master of the
Rolls or a Vice-chancellor. The framers of royal speeches should be picked
out from the number of those who have the largest bumps of
<em>secretiveness</em>; and those possessing <em>inhabitiveness</em>,
producing the desire of <em>permanence in place</em>, should be shunned as
much as possible. No bishop should be appointed whose bump of
<em>veneration</em> would not require him to wear a hat constructed like
that of PUNCH, to allow his <em>organ</em> full <em>play</em>; and the
development of <em>number</em>, if large, might ensure a Chancellor of the
Exchequer whose calculations could at least be relied upon.</p>
<p>Our great objection to the plan is this&mdash;that it might be abused
by parties bumping their own heads, and raising tumours for the sake of
obtaining credit for different qualities. Thus a terrific crack at the
back of the ear might produce so great an elevation of the organ of
<em>combativeness</em> as might obtain for the greatest coward a
reputation for the greatest courage; and a thundering rap on the centre of
the head might raise on the skull of the veriest brute a bump of, and name
for, <em>benevolence</em>.</p>

<h2>NEW CODE OF SIGNALS.</h2>
<p>The immense importance of the signals now used in the royal navy, by
facilitating the communication between ships at sea; has suggested to an
ingenious member of the Scientific Association, the introduction of a
telegraphic code of signals to be employed in society generally, where the
<em>viva voce</em> mode of communication might be either inconvenient or
embarrassing. The inventor has specially devoted his attention to the
topics peculiarly interesting to both sexes, and proposes by his system to
remove all those impediments to a free and unreserved interchange of
sentiment between a lady and gentleman, which feminine timidity on the one
side&mdash;natural <em>gaucherie</em> on the other&mdash;dread of
committing one&rsquo;s self, or fear of transgressing the rules of good
breeding, now throw in the way of many well-disposed young persons. He
explains his system, by supposing that an unmarried lady and gentleman
meet for the first time at a public ball: <em>he</em> is enchanted with
the sylph-like grace of the lady in a waltz&mdash;<em>she</em>, fascinated
with the superb black moustaches of the gentleman. Mutual interest is
created in their bosoms, and the gentleman signalizes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you perceive how much I am struck by your
beauty?&rdquo;&mdash;by twisting the tip of his right moustache with the
finger and thumb of the corresponding hand. If the gentleman be unprovided
with these foreign appendages, the right ear must be substituted.</p>
<p>The lady replies by an affirmative signal, or the
contrary:&mdash;<em>e.g.</em> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the lady arranges her
bouquet with the left hand. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; a similar operation with the
right hand. Assuming the answer to have been favourable, the gentleman, by
slowly throwing back his head, and gently drawing up his stock with the
left hand, signals&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like <em>this</em> style of person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady must instantly lower her eyelids, and appear to count the
sticks of her fan, which will express&mdash;&ldquo;Immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman then thrusts the thumb of his left-hand into the arm-hole
of his waistcoat, taps three times carelessly with his fingers upon his
chest. By this signal he means to say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your little heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady plucks a leaf out of her bouquet, and flings it playfully over
her left shoulder, meaning thereby to intimate that her vital organ is
&ldquo;as free as <em>that</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman, encouraged by the last signal, clasps his hands, and by
placing both his thumbs together, protests that &ldquo;Heaven has formed
them for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the lady must, unhesitatingly, touch the fourth finger of her
left hand with the index finger of the right; by which emphatic signal she
means to say&mdash;&ldquo;No nonsense, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman instantly repels the idea, by expanding the palms of both
hands, and elevating his eyebrows. This is the point at which he should
make the most important signal in the code. It is done by inserting the
finger and thumb of the right hand into the waistcoat pocket, and
expresses, &ldquo;What metal do you carry?&rdquo; or, more popularly,
&ldquo;What is the amount of your banker&rsquo;s account?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady replies by tapping her fan on the back of her left hand;
<em>one</em> distinct tap for every thousand pounds she possesses. If the
number of taps be satisfactory to the gentleman, he must, by a deep
inspiration, inflate his lungs so as to cause a visible heaving of his
chest, and then, fixing his eyes upon the chandelier, slap his forehead
with an expression of suicidal determination. This is a very difficult
signal, which will require some practice to execute properly. It
means&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity my sad state! If you refuse to love me, I&rsquo;ll blow my
miserable brains out.&rdquo; The lady may, by shaking her head
incredulously, express a reasonable doubt that the gentleman possesses any
brains.</p>
<p>After a few more preliminary signals, the lover comes to the point by
dropping his gloves on the floor, thereby beseeching the lady to allow him
to offer her his hand and fortune.</p>
<p>To which she, by letting fall her handkerchief, replies&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask papa and mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is only an imperfect outline of the code which the inventor
asserts may be introduced with wonderful advantage in the streets, the
theatres, at churches, and dissenting chapels; and, in short, everywhere
that the language of the lips cannot be used.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S INFORMATION FOR THE PEOPLE.&mdash;No. 2.</h2>
<h3>THE THERMOMETER.</h3>
<p><em>General Description</em>.&mdash;The thermometer is an instrument
for showing the <em>temperature</em>; for by it we can either see how fast
a man&rsquo;s blood boils when he is in a passion, or, according as the
seasons have occurred this year, how cold it is in summer, and how hot in
winter. It is mostly cased in tin, all the brass being used up by certain
lecturers, who are faced with the latter metal. It has also a glass tube,
with a bulb at the end, exactly like a tobacco-pipe, with the bowl closed
up; except that, instead of tobacco, they put mercury into it. As the heat
increases, the mercury expands, precisely as the smoke would in a pipe, if
it were confined to the tube. A register is placed behind the tube,
crossed by a series of horizontal lines, the whole resembling a wooden
milk-score when the customer is several weeks in arrear.</p>
<p><em>Derivation of Name</em>.&mdash;The thermometer derives its name
from two Greek words, signifying &ldquo;measure of heat;&rdquo; a
designation which has caused much warm discussion, for the instrument is
also employed to tell when it freezes, by those persons who are too
scientific to find out by the tips of their fingers and the blueness of
their noses.</p>
<p><em>History and Literature of the Thermometer</em>.&mdash;The origin of
the instrument is involved in a depth of obscurity considerably below
<em>zero</em>; Pliny mentions its use by a celebrated brewer of
B&oelig;otia; we have succeeded, after several years&rsquo; painful
research, in tracing the invention of the instrument to Mercury, who,
being the god of thieves, very likely stole it from somebody else. Of
ancient writers, there are few except Hannibal (who used it on crossing
the Alps) and Julius C&aelig;sar, that notice it. Bacon treats of the
instrument in his &ldquo;Novum Organum;&rdquo; from which Newton cabbaged
his ideas in his &ldquo;Principia,&rdquo; in the most unprincipled manner.
The thermometer remained stationary till the time of Robinson Crusoe, who
clearly suggested, if he did not invent the register, now universally
adopted, which so nearly resembles his mode of measuring time by means of
notched sticks. Fahrenheit next took it in hand, and because his
calculations were founded on a mistake, his scale is always adopted in
England. Raumur altered the system, and instead of giving the thermometer
mercury, administered to it &lsquo;cold without,&rsquo; or spirits of wine
diluted with water. Celsius followed, and advised a medium fluid, so that
his thermometer is known as the centigrade. De Lisle made such important
improvements, that they have never been attended to; and Mr. Sex&rsquo;s
differential thermometer has given rise to considerably more than a
half-dozen different opinions. All these persons have written learnedly on
the subject, blowing respectively hot or cold, as their tastes vary. The
most recent work is that by Professor Thompson&mdash;a splendid octavo,
hot-pressed, and just warm from the printer&rsquo;s. Though this writer
disagrees with Raumur&rsquo;s temperance principles, and uses the
strongest spirit he can get, instead of mercury, we are assured that he is
no relation whatever to Messrs. Thompson and Fearon of Holborn-hill.</p>
<p><em>Concluding Remarks and Description of Punch&rsquo;s
Thermometer</em>.&mdash;It must be candidly acknowledged by every
unprejudiced mind, that the thermometer question has been most shamefully
handled by the scientific world. It is made an exclusive matter; they keep
it all to themselves; they talk about Fahren<em>heit</em> with the utmost
coolness; of Raumur in un-understandable jargon, and fire whole volleys of
words concerning the centigrade scale, till one&rsquo;s head spins round
with their inexplicable dissertations. What is the use of these
interminable technicalities to the world at large? Do they enlighten the
rheumatic as to how many coats they may put on, for the Midsummer days of
this variable climate? Do their barometers tell us when to take an
umbrella, or when to leave it at home? No. Who, we further ask, knows
<em>how</em> hot it is when the mercury stands at 120&deg;, or how cold it
is when opposite 32&deg; of Fahrenheit? Only the initiated, a class of
persons that can generally stand fire like salamanders, or make themselves
comfortable in an ice-house.</p>
<p>Deeply impressed with the importance of the subject, PUNCH has invented
a new thermometer, which <em>may</em> be understood by the
&ldquo;people&rdquo; whom he addresses&mdash;the unlearned in
caloric&mdash;the ignorant of the principles of expansion and dilatation.
Everybody can tell, without a thermometer, if it be a coat colder or a
cotton waistcoat warmer than usual when he is <em>out</em>. But at home!
Ah, there&rsquo;s the rub! There it has been impossible to ascertain how
to face the storm, or to turn one&rsquo;s back upon the sunshine, till
to-day. PUNCH&rsquo;S thermometer decides the question, and here we give a
diagram of it. Owing a stern and solemn duty to the public, PUNCH has
indignantly spurned the offers of the British Association to join in their
mummeries at Plymouth&mdash;to appear at their dinners for the debasement
of science. No; here in his own pages, and in them only, doth he propound
his invention. But he is not exclusive; having published his wonderful
invention, he invites the makers to copy his plan. Mr. Murphy is already
busily arranging his Almanac for 1842, by means of a PUNCH thermometer,
made by Carey and Co.</p>

<h3>THE SPEAKERSHIP.</h3>
<p>The Parliamentary <em>lucus a non lucendo</em>&mdash;the Speaker who
never speaks&mdash;the gentleman who always holds his own tongue, except
when he wants others to hold theirs&mdash;the man who fills the chair,
which is about three times too big for him&mdash;is not, after all, to be
changed. But the incoming tenants of office have resolved to take him as a
fixture, though not at a fair valuation; for they do nothing but find
fault all the time they are agreeing to let him remain on the premises.
For our own part, we see no objection to the arrangement; for Mr. Lefevre,
we believe, shakes his head as slowly and majestically as his
predecessors, and rattles his teeth over the <em>r</em> in
<em>o</em>R-<em>der</em>, with as much dignity as Sutton, who was the very
perfection of <em>Manners</em>, was accustomed to throw into it. The
fatigues of the office are enough to kill a horse, but asses are not
easily exterminated. It is thought that Lefevre has not been sufficiently
worked, and before giving him a pension, &ldquo;the receiver must,&rdquo;
as the chemist say, &ldquo;be quite exhausted.&rdquo; Tiring him out will
not be enough; but he must be <em>tired</em> again, to entitled him to a
<em>re-tiring</em> allowance.</p>

<h3>MATRIMONIAL AGENCY.</h3>
<p>Lord John Russell begs respectfully to inform the connubially-disposed
portion of the community, that being about to retire from the
establishment in Downing-street, of which he has so long been a member, he
has resolved (at the suggestion of several single ladies <em>about</em>
thirty, and of numerous juvenile gentlemen who have just attained their
majority a <em>second time</em>) to open a</p>
<h4>MATRIMONIAL AGENCY OFFICE,</h4>
<p>where (from his long and successful experience) he trusts to be
honoured by the confidence of the single, and the generous acknowledgments
of the married.</p>
<p>Lord J.R. intends to transact business upon the most liberal scale, and
instead of charging a per centage on the amount of property concerned in
each union, he will take every lady and gentleman&rsquo;s valuation of
themselves, and consider one thousandth part thereof as an adequate
compensation for his services.</p>
<p>Ladies who have <em>lost</em> the registries of their birth can be
supplied with new ones, for any year they please, and the greatest care
will be taken to make them accord with the early recollections of the
lady&rsquo;s schoolfellows and cousins of the same age.</p>
<p>Gentlemen who wear wigs, false calves, or artificial teeth, or use
hair-dye, &amp;c., will be required to state the same, as no deception can
be countenanced by Lord J.R.</p>
<p>Ladies are only required to certify as to the originality of their
teeth; and as Lady Russell will attend exclusively to this department, no
disclosure will take place until all other preliminaries are
satisfactorily arranged.</p>
<p>Young gentlemen with large mustachios and small incomes will find the
MATRIMONIAL AGENCY OFFICE well worthy their attention; and young ladies
who play the piano, speak French, and measure only eighteen inches round
the waist, cannot better consult their own interests than by making an
early application.</p>
<p>N.B. None with red hair need apply, unless with a mother&rsquo;s
certificate that it was always considered to be auburn.</p>
<p>Wanted several buxom widows for the commencement. If in weeds, will be
preferred.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;MATTERS IN FACT,&rdquo; AND &ldquo;MATTERS IN LAW.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Law is the perfection of reason!&rdquo; said, some sixty years
ago, an old powder-wigged priest of Themis, in his
&ldquo;enthusymusy&rdquo; for the venerable lady; and what one of her
learned adorers, from handsome Jock Campbell down to plain Counsellor
Dunn, would dare question the maxim? A generous soul, who, like the fabled
lady of the Arabian tale, drops gold at every word she utters, varying in
value from one guinea to five thousand, according to the quality of the
hand that is stretched forth to receive it, cannot possibly be other than
reason herself. But to appreciate this dear creature justly, it is
absolutely necessary to be in her service. No ordinary lay person can
judge her according to her deserts. You must be initiated into her
mysteries before you can detect her beauties; but once admitted to her
august presence&mdash;once enrolled as her sworn slave&mdash;your eyes
become opened and clear, and you see her as she is, the marvel of the
world. Yet, though so difficult of comprehension, no man, nor woman, nor
child, must plead ignorance of her excellencies. To be ignorant of any one
of them is an impossibility as palpable as that &ldquo;the Queen can do no
wrong,&rdquo; or any other admirable fiction which the genius of our
ancestors has bequeathed us. We all must know the law, or be continually
whipped! A hard rule, though an inflexible one. But the schoolmaster is
abroad&mdash;PUNCH, that teaches all, must teach the law; and, as a
preliminary indispensable, he now proceeds to give a few definitions of
the principal matters contained in that science, which bear a different
meaning from what they would in ordinary language. The admiring neophyte
will perceive with delight the vast superiority apparent in all cases of
&ldquo;matters of law,&rdquo; or &ldquo;matters of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To illustrate:&mdash;When a lovely girl, all warmth and confidence,
steals on tiptoe from her lonely chamber, and, lighted by the moon, when
&ldquo;pa&rsquo;s&rdquo; asleep, drops from the balcony into the arms of
some soft youth, as warm as she, who has been waiting to whisk her off to
Hymen&rsquo;s altar&mdash;that is generally understood as</p>

<p>AN ATTACHMENT IN FACT.</p>
</div>
<p>When an ugly &ldquo;bum,&rdquo; well up to trap, creeps like a rascal
from the sheriff&rsquo;s-office, and with his <em>capias</em> armed, ere
you are half-dressed, gives you the chase, and, as you &ldquo;leg&rdquo;
away for the bare life, his knuckles dig into the seat of your
unmentionables, gripping you like a tiger&mdash;that indeed is <em>une
autre chose</em>, that is</p>

<p>AN ATTACHMENT IN LAW.</p>
</div>
<p>When you remark a round, rosy, jolly fellow, shining from top to toe,
&ldquo;philandering&rdquo; down Regent-street, with a self-satisfied grin,
that seems to say, &ldquo;Match me that, demme!&rdquo; and casting looks
of pity&mdash;mellowed through his eye-glass&mdash;on all passers, you may
fairly conclude that that happy dog has just slipped into</p>

<p>A BOND-STREET SUIT.</p>
</div>
<p>But when you perceive a gaunt, yellow spectre of a man, reduced to his
last <em>chemise</em>, and that a sad spectacle of ancient purity,
starting from Lincoln&rsquo;s-Inn, and making all haste for
Waterloo-bridge, the inference is rather natural, that he is blessed
with</p>

<p>It being dangerous to take too great a meal at a time, and PUNCH
knowing well the difficulty of digesting properly over-large quantities of
mental food, he concludes his first lecture on L&mdash;A&mdash;W. Whether
he will continue here his definitions of legal terms, or not, time and his
humour shall determine.</p>

<h3>A DRESS REHEARSAL.</h3>
<p>Lord Melbourne, imitating the example of the ancient philosophers, is
employing the last days of his political existence in composing a learned
discourse &ldquo;On the Shortness of Ministerial Life.&rdquo; To try the
effect of it, his lordship gives a <em>full dress</em> dinner-party,
immediately after the meeting of Parliament, to several of his friends. On
the removal of the cloth, he will read the essay, and then the
Queen&rsquo;s intended speech, in which she civilly gives his lordship
leave to provide himself with another <em>place</em>. Where, in the whole
range of history, could we meet with a similar instance of magnanimity?
Where, with such a noble picture&mdash;of a great soul rising superior to
adversity? Seneca in the bath, uttering moral apophthegms with his dying
breath&mdash;Socrates jesting over his bowl of hemlock juice&mdash;were
great creatures&mdash;immense minds; but Lord Melbourne reading his own
dismissal to his friends&mdash;after dinner, too!&mdash;over his first
glass of wine&mdash;leaves them at an immeasurable distance. Oh! that we
had the power of poor Wilkie! what a picture we could make of such a
subject.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
<h2>THE DRAMA.</h2>
<h3>VAUXHALL GARDENS.</h3>
<p>Some of the melancholy duties of this life afford a more subdued, and,
therefore, a more satisfactory pleasure than scores with which duty has
nothing to do, or those of mere enjoyment. If, for instance, the friend,
whose feeds we have helped to eat, whose cellars we have done our part to
empty for the last quarter of a century, should happen to fall ill; if the
doctors shake their heads, and warn us to make haste to his bedside, there
is always a large proportion of honey to be extracted, in obeying the
summons, out of the sting of parting, recounting old reminiscences, and
gossipping about old times, never, alas! to return. But should we neglect
the summons, where would the stings of conscience end?</p>
<p>Impelled by such a sense of duty, we wended our way to the &ldquo;royal
property,&rdquo; to take a last look at the long-expiring gardens. It was
a wet night&mdash;the lamps burnt dimly&mdash;the military band played in
the minor key&mdash;the waiters stalked about with so silent, melancholy a
tread, that we took their towels for pocket-handkerchiefs; the concert in
the open <em>rain</em> went off tamely&mdash;dirge-like, in spite of the
&ldquo;Siege of Acre,&rdquo; which was described in a set of quadrilles,
embellished with blue fire and maroons, and adorned with a dozen double
drums, thumped at intervals, like death notes, in various parts of the
doomed gardens. The <em>divertissement</em> was anything but diverting,
when we reflect upon the impending fate of the &ldquo;Rotunda,&rdquo; in
which it was performed.</p>
<p>No such damp was, however, thrown over the evolutions of
&ldquo;Ducrow&rsquo;s beautiful horses and equestrian
<em>artistes</em>,&rdquo; including &ldquo;the new grand entr&eacute;e,
and cavalcade of Amazons.&rdquo; They had no sympathy with the decline and
fall of the <em>Simpsonian</em> empire. They were strangers, interlopers,
called in like mutes and feathers, to grace the &ldquo;funeral
show,&rdquo; to give a more graceful flourish to the final exit. The
horses pawed the sawdust, evidently unconscious that the earth it covered
would soon &ldquo;be let on lease for building ground;&rdquo; the riders
seemed in the hey-day of their equestrian triumph. Let them, however,
derive from the fate of Vauxhall, a deep, a fearful lesson!&mdash;though
we shudder as we write, it shall not be said that destruction came upon
them unawares&mdash;that no warning voice had been raised&mdash;that even
the squeak of PUNCH was silent! Let them not sneer, and call us
superstitious&mdash;we do <em>not</em> give credence to supernatural
agency as a fixed and general principle; but we did believe in Simpson,
and stake our professional reputation upon Widdicomb.</p>
<p>That Vauxhall gardens were under the especial protection of, that they
drew the very breath of their attractiveness from, the ceremonial Simpson,
who can deny? When he flitted from walk to walk, from box to box, and
welcomed everybody to the &ldquo;royal property,&rdquo; right royally did
things go on! Who would <em>then</em> have dreamt that the illustrious
George&mdash;he of the Piazza&mdash;would ever be &ldquo;honoured with
instructions to sell;&rdquo; that his eulogistic pen would be employed in
giving the puff superlative to the Elysian haunts of quondam
fashion&mdash;in other words, in painting the lily, gilding refined gold?
But, alas! Simpson, the tutelar deity, has departed (&ldquo;died,&rdquo;
some say, but we don&rsquo;t believe it), and at the moment he made his
last bow, Vauxhall ought to have closed; it was madness&mdash;the madness
which will call us, peradventure, superstitious&mdash;which kept the gates
open when Simpson&rsquo;s career closed&mdash;it was an anomaly, for like
Love and Heaven, Simpson was Vauxhall, and Vauxhall was Simpson!</p>
<p>Let Ducrow reflect upon these things&mdash;we dare not speak
out&mdash;but a tutelar being watches over, and giveth vitality to his
arena&mdash;his ring is, he may rely upon it, a fairy one&mdash;while
<em>that</em> mysterious being dances and prances in it, all will go well;
his horses will not stumble, never will his clowns forget a syllable of
their antiquated jokes. O! let him then, while seriously reflecting upon
Simpson and the fate of Vauxhall, give good heed unto the Methuselah, who
hath already passed his second centenary in the circle!</p>
<p>These were our awful reflections while viewing the scenes in the
circle, very properly constructed in the Rotunda. They overpowered
us&mdash;we dared not stay to see the fireworks, &ldquo;in the midst of
which Signora Rossini was to make her terrific ascent and descent on a
rope three hundred feet high.&rdquo; She <em>might</em> have been the
sprite of Madame Saqui; in fact, the &ldquo;Vauxhall Papers&rdquo;
published in the gardens, put forth a legend, which favours such a
dreadful supposition! We refer our readers to them&mdash;they are only
sixpence a-piece.</p>
<p>Of course the gardens were full in spite of the weather; for what must
be the callousness of that man who could let <em>the</em> gardens pass
under the hammer of George Robins, without bidding them an affecting
farewell? Good gracious! We can hardly believe such insensibility does
exist. Hasten then, dear readers, as you would fly to catch the expiring
sigh of a fine old boon companion&mdash;hasten to take your parting slice
of ham, your last bowl of arrack, even now while the great auctioneer says
&ldquo;Going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For your sake, and yours only, Alfred Bunn (whose disinterestedness has
passed into a theatrical proverb), arrests the arm of his friend of the
Auction Mart in its descent. Attend to <em>his</em> bidding. Do
not&mdash;oh! do not wait till the vulcan of the Bartholomew-lane smithy
lets fall his hammer upon the anvil of pleasure, to announce that the
Royal Property is&mdash;&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h3>A LADY AND GENTLEMAN</h3>
<h4>IN A PECULIARLY PERPLEXING PREDICAMENT.</h4>
<p>Mrs. Waylett and Mr. Keeley were the lady and gentleman who were placed
in the peculiarly perplexing predicament of making a second-hand French
interlude supportable to an English Opera audience. In this they more than
succeeded&mdash;for they caused it to be amusing; they made the most of
what they had to do, which was not much, and of what they had to say,
which was a great deal too much; for the piece would be far more tolerable
if considerably shorn of its unfair proportions. The translator seems to
have followed the verbose text of his original with minute fidelity,
except where the idioms bothered him; and although the bills declare it is
adapted by Mr. Charles Selby to the English stage, the thing is as
essentially French as it is when performed at the <em>Palais Royal</em>,
except where the French language is introduced, when, in every instance,
the labours of correct transcription were evidently above the powers of
the translator. The best part of the adaptation is the exact fitness of
the performers to their parts; we mean as far as concerns their
<em>personnel</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, all the readers of PUNCH know Mr. Keeley. Let them, then,
conceive him an uncle at five-and-thirty, but docking himself of six
years&rsquo; age when asked impertinent questions. He has a head of fine
auburn hair, and dresses in a style that a <em>badaud</em> would call
&ldquo;quiet;&rdquo; that is to say, he wears brass buttons to his coat,
which is green, and adorned with a velvet collar. In short, it is not
nearly so fine as Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s, for it has no velvet at the
cuffs; and is not embroidered. Add white unhintables, and you have an
imaginative portrait of the hero. But the heroine! Ah! she, dear reader,
if you have a taste for full-blown beauty and widows, she will coax the
coin out of your pockets, and yourselves into the English Opera House,
when we have told you what she acts, and how she acts. Imagine her, the
syren, with the quiet, confiding smile, the tender melting voice, the
pleasing highly-bred manner; just picture her in the character of a
Parisian widow&mdash;the free, unshackled, fascinating Parisian
widow&mdash;the child of liberty&mdash;the mother of&mdash;no, not a
mother; for the instant a husband dies, the orphans are transferred to
convent schools to become nephews and nieces. Well, we say for the third
time, conceive Mrs. Waylett, dressed with modest elegance, a single rose
in her hair&mdash;sympathise with her as she rushes upon the stage (which
is &ldquo;set&rdquo; for the <em>chambre meubl&eacute;e</em> of a country
inn), escaping from the persecutions of a persevering traveller who
<em>will</em> follow her charms, her modest elegance, her single rose,
wherever they make their appearance. She locks the door, and orders
supper, declaring she will leave the house immediately after it is eaten
and paid for. Alas! the danger increases, and with it her fears; she will
pay without eating; and as the diligence is going off, she will resume her
journey, but&mdash;a new misfortune&mdash;there is no place in it! She
will, then, hire a postchaise; and the landlady goes to strike the
bargain, having been duly paid for a bed which has not been lain in, and a
supper that has not been eaten. As the lady hastens away, with every
prospect of not returning, the piece would inevitably end here, if a
gentleman did not arrive by the very diligence which has just driven off
full, and taken the same chamber the lady has just vacated; but more
particularly if the only chaise in the place had not been hired by the
lady&rsquo;s wicked persecutor on purpose to detain her. She, of course,
returns to the twice-let chamber, and finds it occupied by a sentimental
traveller.</p>
<p>Here we have the &ldquo;peculiarly perplexing
predicament&rdquo;&mdash;a lady and gentleman, and only one chamber
between them! This is the plot; all that happens afterwards is merely
supplementary. To avoid the continued persecutions of the unseen Adolphe,
the lady agrees, after some becoming hesitation, to pass to the hostess as
the wife of the sentimental traveller. The landlady is satisfied, for what
so natural as that they <em>should</em> have but one bed-room between
them? so she carefully locks them in, and the audience have the pleasure
of seeing them pass the night together&mdash;how we will not say&mdash;let
our readers go and see. Yet we must in justice add that the &ldquo;lady
and gentleman&rdquo; make at the end of the piece the <em>amende</em> good
morals demand&mdash;they get married.</p>
<p>To the performers, and to them alone, are we indebted for any of the
amusement this trifle affords. Mr. Keeley and Mrs. Waylett were, so far as
acting goes, perfection; for never were parts better fitted to them. There
are only three characters in the piece; the third, the hostess of the
<em>&ldquo;Cochon bleu,&rdquo;</em> is very well done by Mrs. Selby. The
persecuting Adolphe (who turns out to be the gentleman&rsquo;s nephew)
never appears upon the stage, for all his rude efforts to get into the
lady&rsquo;s chamber are fruitless.</p>
<p>Such is the prying disposition of the British public, that the house
was crammed to the ceiling to see a lady and a gentleman placed in a
peculiarly perplexing predicament.</p>
