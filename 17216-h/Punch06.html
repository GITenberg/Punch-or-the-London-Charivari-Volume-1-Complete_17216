<p><span class="hide">T</span>he conversation now subsided into
&ldquo;private and confidential&rdquo; whispers, from which I could learn
that Miss O&rsquo;Brannigan had consented to quit her father&rsquo;s halls
with Terence that very night, and, before the priest, to become his true
and lawful wife.</p>
<p>It had been previously understood that those of the guests who lived at
a distance from the lodge should sleep there that night. Nothing could
have been more favourable for the designs of the lovers; and it was
arranged between them, that Miss Biddy was to steal from her chamber into
the yard, at daybreak, and apprise her lover of her presence by flinging a
handful of gravel against his window. Terence&rsquo;s horse was warranted
to carry double, and the lady had taken the precaution to secure the key
of the stable where he was placed.</p>
<p>It was long after midnight before the company began to
separate;&mdash;cloaks, shawls, and tippets were called for; a jug of
punch of extra strength was compounded, and a <em>doch an
dhurris</em><sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1. A drink at the
door;&mdash;a farewell cup.</span> of the steaming beverage administered
to every individual before they were permitted to depart. At length the
house was cleared of its guests, with the exception of those who were to
remain and take beds there. Amongst the number were the haberdasher and
your uncle. The latter was shown into a chamber in which a pleasant turf
fire was burning on the hearth.</p>
<p>Although Terence&rsquo;s mind was full of sweet anticipations and
visions of future grandeur, he could not avoid feeling a disagreeable
sensation arising from the soaked state of his boots; and calculating that
it still wanted three or four hours of daybreak, he resolved to have us
dry and comfortable for his morning&rsquo;s adventure. With this intention
he drew us off, and placed us on the hearth before the fire, and threw
himself on the bed&mdash;not to sleep&mdash;he would sooner have committed
suicide&mdash;but to meditate upon the charms of Miss Biddy and her
thousand pounds.</p>
<p>But our strongest resolutions are overthrown by circumstances&mdash;the
ducking, the dancing, and the <em>potteen</em>, had so exhausted Terence,
that he unconsciously shut, first, one eye, then the other, and, finally,
he fell fast asleep, and dreamed of running away with the heiress on his
back, through a shaking bog, in which he sank up to the middle at every
step. His vision was, however, suddenly dispelled by a smart rattle
against his window. A moment was sufficient to recall him to his
senses&mdash;he knew it was Miss Biddy&rsquo;s signal, and, jumping from
the bed, drew back the cotton window-curtains and peered earnestly out:
but though the day had begun to break, it was still too dark to enable him
to distinguish any person on the lawn. In a violent hurry he seized on
your humble servant, and endeavoured to draw me on; but, alas! the heat of
the fire had so shrank me from my natural dimensions, that he might as
well have attempted to introduce his leg and foot into an eel-skin.
Flinging me in a rage to the further corner of the room, he essayed to
thrust his foot into my companion, which had been reduced to the same
shrunken state as myself. In vain he tugged, swore, and strained; first
with one, and then with another, until the stitches in our sides grinned
with perfect torture; the perspiration rolled down his forehead&mdash;his
eyes were staring, his teeth set, and every nerve in his body was
quivering with his exertions&mdash;but still he could not force us on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done!&rdquo; he ejaculated in despairing
accents. A bright thought struck him suddenly, that he might find a pair
of boots belonging to some of the other visitors, with which he might make
free on so pressing an emergency. It was but sending them back, with an
apology for the mistake, on the following day. With this idea he sallied
from his room, and groped his way down stairs to find the scullery, where
he knew the boots were deposited by the servant at night. This scullery
was detached from the main building, and to reach it it was necessary to
cross an angle of the yard. Terence cautiously undid the bolts and
fastenings of the back door, and was stealthily picking his steps over the
rough stones of the yard, when he was startled by a fierce roar behind
him, and at the same moment the teeth of Towser, the great watch-dog, were
fastened in his nether garments. Though very much alarmed, he concealed
his feelings, and presuming on a slight previous intimacy with his
assailant, he addressed him in a most familiar manner, calling him
&ldquo;poor fellow&rdquo; and &ldquo;old Towser,&rdquo; explained to him
the ungentlemanly liberty he was taking with his buckskins, and requested
him to let go his hold, as he had quite enough of that sport. Towser was,
however, not to be talked out of his private notions; he foully suspected
your uncle of being on no good design, and replied to every remonstrance
he made with a growl and a shake, that left no doubt he would resort to
more vigorous measures in case of opposition. Afraid or ashamed to call
for help, Terence was kept in this disagreeable state, nearly frozen to
death with cold and trembling with terror, until the morning was
considerably advanced, when he was discovered by some of the servants, who
released him from the guardianship of his surly captor. Without waiting to
account for the extraordinary circumstances in which he had been found, he
bolted into the house, rushed up to his bed-chamber, and, locking the
door, threw himself into a chair, overwhelmed with shame and vexation.</p>
<p>But poor Terence&rsquo;s troubles were not half over. The beautiful
heiress, after having discharged several volleys of sand and small pebbles
against his window without effect, was returning to her chamber, swelling
with indignation, when she was encountered on the stairs by Tibbins, who,
no doubt prompted by the demon of jealousy, had been watching her
movements. He could not have chosen a more favourable moment to plead his
suit; her mortified vanity, and her anger at what she deemed the culpable
indifference of her lover, made her eager to be revenged on him. It
required, therefore, little persuasion to obtain her consent to elope with
the haberdasher. The key of the stable was in her pocket, and in less than
ten minutes she was sitting beside him in his gig, taking the shortest
road to the priest&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I cannot attempt to describe the rage that Terence flew into, as soon
as he learned the trick he had been served; he vowed to be the death of
Tibbins, and it is probable he would have carried his threat into effect,
if the haberdasher had not prudently kept out of his way until his anger
had grown cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said I, addressing the narrator, &ldquo;you lost the
opportunity of figuring at Miss Biddy&rsquo;s wedding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the &lsquo;wife-catcher;&rsquo; &ldquo;but
Terence soon retrieved his credit, for in less than three months after his
disappointment with the heiress, we were legging it as his wedding with
Miss Debby Doolan, a greater fortune and a prettier girl than the one he
had lost: and, by-the-bye, that reminds me of a funny scene which took
place when the bride came to throw the stocking&mdash;hoo! hoo! hoo!
hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here my friends, the boots, burst into a long and loud fit of laughter;
while I, ignorant of the cause of their mirth, looked gravely on,
wondering when it would subside. Instead, however, of their laughter
lessening, the cachinnations became so violent that I began to feel
seriously alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friends!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo! hoo!&rdquo; shouted the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This excessive mirth may be dangerous&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>A peal of laughter shook their leathern sides, and they rolled from
side to side on their chair. Fearful of their falling, I put out my hand
to support them, when a sense of acute pain made me suddenly withdraw it.
I started, opened my eyes, and discovered that I had laid hold of the
burning remains of the renowned &ldquo;wife-catchers,&rdquo; which I had
in my sleep placed upon the fire.</p>
<p>As I gazed mournfully upon the smoking relics of the ancient allies of
our house, I resolved to record this strange adventure; but you know I
never had much taste for writing, Jack, so I now confide the task to you.
As he concluded, my uncle raised his tumbler to his lips, and I could
perceive a tear sparkling in his eye&mdash;a genuine tribute of regard to
the memory of the venerated &ldquo;<em>Wife Catchers</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ENGLISH AND AMERICAN PRODUCE.</h3>
<p>We find, by the <em>Times</em> of Saturday, the British <em>teasel</em>
crops in the parish of Melksham have fallen entirely to the ground, and
from their appearance denote a complete failure. Another paragraph in the
same paper speaks quite as discouragingly of the appearance of the
American <em>Teazle</em> at the Haymarket.</p>

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<h3>A COMPLETE ENCYCLOP&AElig;DIA OF ALL THE REQUISITES, DECORATIVE,
EDUCATIONAL, AND RECREATIVE, FOR GENTILITY.</h3>
<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>
<p>A popular encyclop&aelig;dia of the requisites for gentility&mdash;a
companion to the toilet, the <em>salons</em>, the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, the
streets, and the police-stations, has long been felt to be a desideratum
by every one aspiring to good-breeding. The few works which treat on the
subject have all become as obselete as &ldquo;hot cockles&rdquo; and
&ldquo;crambo.&rdquo; &ldquo;The geste of King Horne,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;&Beta;&Alpha;&Sigma;&Iota;&Lambda;&Iota;&Kappa;&Omicron;&Nu;&rdquo;
of King Jamie, &ldquo;Peacham&rsquo;s Complete Gentleman,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Poesye of princelye Practice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dame Juliana
Berners&rsquo; Book of St. Alban&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Jewel for
Gentrie,&rdquo; are now confined to bibliopoles and bookstalls. Even more
modern productions have shared the same fate. &ldquo;The Whole Duty of
Man&rdquo; has long been consigned to the trunk-maker,
&ldquo;Chesterfield&rsquo;s Letters&rdquo; are now dead letters, and the
&ldquo;Young Man&rdquo; lights his cigar with his &ldquo;Best
Companion.&rdquo; It is true, that in lieu of these, several works have
emanated from the press, adapted to the change of manners, and
consequently admirably calculated to supply their places. We need only
instance &ldquo;The Flash Dictionary,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Book of
Etiquette,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Guide to the Kens and Cribs of London,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The whole Art of Tying the Cravat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Hand-book
of Boxing;&rdquo; but it remains for us to remove the disadvantages which
attend the acquirement of each of these noble arts and sciences in a
detached form.</p>
<p>The possessor of an inquiring and genteel mind has now to wander for
his politeness to Paternoster-row<sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote">2.
&ldquo;Book of Etiquette.&rdquo; Longman and Co.</span>; to Pierce Egan,
for his knowledge of men and manners; and to Owen Swift, for his knightly
accomplishments, and exercises of chivalry.</p>
<p>We undertake to collect and condense these scattered radii into one
brilliant focus, so that a gentleman, by reading his &ldquo;own
book,&rdquo; may be made acquainted with the best means of ornamenting his
own, or disfiguring a policeman&rsquo;s, person&mdash;how to conduct
himself at the dinner-table, or at the bar of Bow-street&mdash;how to turn
a compliment to a lady, or carry on a chaff with a cabman.</p>
<p>These are high and noble objects! A wider field for social elevation
cannot well be imagined. Our plan embraces the enlightenment and
refinement of every scion of a noble house, and all the junior clerks in
the government offices&mdash;from the happy recipient of an allowance of
50&pound; per month from &ldquo;the Governor,&rdquo; to the dashing
acceptor of a salary of thirty shillings a week from a highly-respectable
house in the City&mdash;from the gentleman who occupies a suite of
apartments in the Clarendon, to the lodger in the three-pair back, in an
excessively back street at Somers Town.</p>
<p>With these incentives, we will proceed at once to our great and
glorious task, confident that our exertions will be appreciated, and
obtain for us an introduction into the best circles.</p>
<h4>PRELUDE.</h4>
<p>We trust that our polite readers will commence the perusal of our pages
with a pleasure equal to that which we feel in sitting down to write them;
for they call up welcome recollections of those days (we are literary and
seedy now!) when our coats emanated from the laboratory of Stultz, our
pantaloons from Buckmaster, and our boots from Hoby, whilst our glossy
beaver&mdash;now, alas! supplanted by a rusty goss&mdash;was fabricated by
no less a thatcher than the illustrious Moore. They will remind us of our
Coryphean conquests at the Opera&mdash;our triumphs in Rotten
row&mdash;our dinners at Long&rsquo;s and the Clarendon&mdash;our nights
at Offley&rsquo;s and the watch-house&mdash;our glorious runs with the
Beaufort hounds, and our exhilarating runs from the sheriffs&rsquo;
officers&mdash;our month&rsquo;s sporting on the heathery moors, and our
day rule when rusticating in the Bench!</p>
<p>We are in &ldquo;the sear and yellow leaf&rdquo;&mdash;there is nothing
green about us now! We have put down our seasoned hunter, and have mounted
the winged Pegasus. The brilliant Burgundy and sparkling Hock no longer
mantle in our glass; but Barclay&rsquo;s beer&mdash;nectar of gods and
coalheavers&mdash;mixed with hippocrene&mdash;the Muses&rsquo; &ldquo;cold
without&rdquo;&mdash;is at present our only beverage. The grouse are by us
undisturbed in their bloomy mountain covert. We are now content to climb
Parnassus and our garret stairs. The Albany, that sanctuary of erring
bachelors, with its guardian beadle, are to us but memories, for we have
become the denizens of a roomy attic (ring the top bell twice), and are
only saluted by an Hebe of all-work and our printer&rsquo;s devil!</p>
<p>ON DRESS IN GENERAL.&mdash;<em>L&rsquo;habit fait le
moine</em>.&mdash;It has been laid down by Brummel, Bulwer, and other
great authorities, that &ldquo;the tailor makes the man;&rdquo; and he
would be the most daring of sceptics who would endeavour to controvert
this axiom. Your first duty, therefore, is to place yourself in the hands
of some distinguished schneider, and from him take out your patent of
gentility&mdash;for a man with an &ldquo;elegant coat&rdquo; to his back
is like a bill at sight endorsed with a good name; whilst a seedy or
ill-cut garment resembles a protested note of hand labelled &ldquo;No
effects.&rdquo; It will also be necessary for you to consult &ldquo;The
Monthly Book of Fashions,&rdquo; and to imitate, as closely as possible,
those elegant and artistical productions of the gifted <em>burin</em>,
which show to perfection &ldquo;What a piece of work is man! How noble in
reason! How infinite in faculties!&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;You must not
consult your own ease and taste (if you have any), for nothing is so
vulgar as to suit your convenience in these matters, as you should
remember that you dress to please others, and not yourself. We have heard
of some eccentric individuals connected with noble families, who have
departed from this rule; but they invariably paid the penalty of their
rashness, being frequently mistaken for men of intellect; and it should
not be forgotten, that any exercise of the mind is a species of labour
utterly incompatible with the perfect man of fashion.</p>
<p>The confiding characters of tailors being generally acknowledged, it is
almost needless to state, that the <em>faintest</em> indication of
seediness will be fatal to your reputation; and as a presentation at the
Insolvent Court is equally fashionable with that of St. James, any
squeamishness respecting your inability to pay could only be looked upon
as a want of moral courage upon your part, and</p>

<h2>MY UNCLE BUCKET.</h2>
<p>The Buckets are a large family! I am one of them&mdash;my uncle Job
Bucket is another. We, the Buckets, are atoms of creation; yet we, the
Buckets, are living types of the immensity of the world&rsquo;s
inhabitants. We illustrate their ups and downs&mdash;their fulness and
their emptiness&mdash;their risings and their falling&mdash;and all the
several goods and ills, the world&rsquo;s denizens in general, and Buckets
in particular, are undoubted heirs to.</p>
<p>It hath ever been the fate of the fulness of one Bucket to guarantee
the emptiness of another; and (mark the moral!) the rising Bucket is the
richly-stored one; its sinking brother&rsquo;s attributes, like
Gratiano&rsquo;s wit, being &ldquo;an infinite deal of nothing.&rdquo;
Hence the adoption of our name for the wooden utensils that have so aptly
fished up this fact from the deep well of truth.</p>
<p>There be certain rods that attract the lightning. We are inclined to
think there be certain Buckets that invite kicking, and our uncle Job was
one of them. He was birched at school for everybody but himself, for he
never deserved it! He was plucked at college&mdash;because some practical
joker placed a utensil, bearing his name, outside the door of the
examining master, and our uncle Job Bucket being unfortunately present,
laughed at the consequent abrasion of his, the examining master&rsquo;s,
shins. He was called to the bar. His first case was, &ldquo;Jane Smith
<em>versus</em> James Smith&rdquo; (no relations). His client was the
female. She had been violently assaulted. He mistook the
initial&mdash;pleaded warmly for the opposing Smith, and glowingly
described the disgraceful conduct of the veriest virago a legal adviser
ever had the pain of speaking of. The verdict was, as he thought, on his
side. The lady favoured him with a living evidence of all the attributes
he was pleased to invent for her benefit, and left him with a proof
impression of her nails upon his face, carrying with her, by way of
<em>souvenir</em>, an ample portion of the skin thereof. Had the condensed
heels of all the horses whose subscription hairs were wrought into his
wig, with one united effort presented him with a kick in his abdominals,
he could not have been more completely &ldquo;knocked out of time&rdquo;
than he was by the mistake of those cursed initials. &ldquo;<em>What about
Smith?</em>&rdquo; sent him out of court! At length he</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Cursed the bar, and declined.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He next turned his attention to building. Things went on swimmingly
during the erection&mdash;so did the houses when built. The proprietorship
of the ground was disputed&mdash;our uncle Job had paid the wrong person.
The buildings were knocked down (by Mr. Robins), and the individual who
had benefited by the suppositionary ownership of the acres let on the
building lease &ldquo;bought the lot,&rdquo; and sent uncle Job a
peculiarly well-worded legal notice, intimating, &ldquo;his respectable
presence would, for the future, approximate to a nuisance and trespass,
and he (Job) would be proceeded against as the statutes directed, if
guilty of the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to follow him through all his various strivings to do
well: he commenced a small-beer brewery, and the thunder turned it all
into vinegar; he tried vinegar, and nothing on earth could make it sour;
he opened a milk-walk, and the parish pump failed; he invented a
waterproof composition&mdash;there was fourteen weeks of drought; he sold
his patent for two-and-sixpence, and had the satisfaction of walking home
for the next three months wet through, from his gossamer to his
<em>ci-devant</em> Wellingtons, now literally, from their hydraulic
powers, &ldquo;<em>pumps</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lost everything but his heart! And uncle Bucket was all heart! a red
cabbage couldn&rsquo;t exceed it in size, and, like that, it seemed
naturally predestined to be everlastingly in a pickle! Still it was a
heart! You were welcomed to his venison when he had it&mdash;his present
saveloy was equally at your service. He must have been remarkably attached
to facetious elderly poultry of the masculine gender, as his invariable
salute to the tenants of his &ldquo;heart&rsquo;s core&rdquo; was,
&ldquo;How are you, my jolly old cock?&rdquo; Coats became threadbare, and
defunct trousers vanished; waistcoats were never replaced; gossamers
floated down the tide of Time; boots, deprived of all hope of future
renovation by the loss of their <em>soles</em>, mouldered in obscurity;
but the clear voice and chuckling salute were changeless as the statutes
of the Medes and Persians, the price and size of penny tarts, or the
accumulating six-and-eightpences gracing a lawyer&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>Poor uncle Job Bucket&rsquo;s fortune had driven &ldquo;him down the
rough tide of power,&rdquo; when first and last we met; all was blighted
save the royal heart; and yet, with shame we own the truth, we blushed to
meet him. Why? ay, why? We own the weakness!&mdash;the heart, the goodly
heart, was almost cased in rags!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right, reader, right; we were a puppy. Lash on, we richly deserve it!
but, consider the fearful influence of worn-out cloth! Can a long series
of unchanging kindness balance patched elbows? are not cracked boots
receipts in full for hours of anxious love and care? does not the kindness
of a life fade &ldquo;like the baseless fabric of a vision&rdquo; before
the withering touch of poverty&rsquo;s stern stamp? Have you ever
felt&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? what? No&mdash;stuff! Yes, yes&mdash;go on, go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will!&mdash;we blushed for our uncle&rsquo;s coat! His heart, God
bless it, never caused a blush on the cheek of man, woman, child, or even
angel, to rise for that. We will confess. Let&rsquo;s see, we are sixty
now (we don&rsquo;t look so much, but we are sixty). Well, be it so. We
were handsome once&mdash;is this vanity at sixty? if so, our grey hairs
are a hatchment for the past. We were &ldquo;swells
once!&mdash;hurrah!&mdash;we were!&rdquo; Stop, this is indecent&mdash;let
us be calm&mdash;our action was like the proceeding of the denuder of
well-sustained and thriving pigs, he who deprives them of their extreme
obesive selvage&mdash;<em>vulgo</em>, &ldquo;<em>we cut it
fat</em>.&rdquo; Bond-street was cherished by our smile, and Ranelagh was
rendered happy by the exhibition of our symmetry. Behold us hessianed in
our haunts, touching the tips of well-gloved fingers to our passing
friends; then fancy the opening and shutting of our back, just as Lord
Adolphus Nutmeg claimed the affinity of &ldquo;kid to kid,&rdquo; to find
our other hand close prisoner made by our uncle Bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, old cock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lunatic, my lord (what lies men tell!), and
dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day! [<em>Exit my lord</em>]. This way.&rdquo; We followed
our uncle&mdash;the end of a blind alley gave us a resting-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; exclaimed our uncle Bucket, &ldquo;this is rare! I
live here&mdash;dine with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mob surrounded us&mdash;we acquiesced, in hopes to reach a place of
shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; exclaimed he of the maternal side,
&ldquo;stand three-halfpence for your feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shelled the necessary out&mdash;he dived into a baker&rsquo;s
shop&mdash;the mob increased&mdash;he hailed us from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, this is your house, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my kitchen. Lend a hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dish of steaming baked potatoes, surmounted by a fractional rib of
consumptive beef, was deposited between the lemon-coloured receptacles of
our thumbs and fingers&mdash;an outcry was raised at the court&rsquo;s
end&mdash;we were almost mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn to the right&mdash;three-pair back&mdash;cut away while
it&rsquo;s warm, and make yourself at home! I&rsquo;ll come with the
beer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We wished our <em>I</em> had been in that bier! We rushed out&mdash;the
gravy basted our <em>pants</em>, and greased our hessians! Lord Adolphus
Nutmeg appeared at the entrance of the court. As we proceeded to our
announced destination,&mdash;&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed his
lordship, &ldquo;the Bedlamite has bitten him!&rdquo; A peal of laughter
rang in our ears&mdash;we rushed into the wrong room, and our uncle Job
Bucket picked us, the shattered dish, the reeking potatoes, and dislodged
beef, from the inmost recesses of a wicker-cradle, where, spite the thumps
and entreaties of a distracted parent, we were all engaged in overlaying a
couple of remarkably promising twins! We can say no more on this frightful
subject. But&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once again we met!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our pride wanted cutting, and fate appeared determined to perform the
operation with a jagged saw!</p>
<p>Tom Racket died! His disease was infectious, and we had been the last
person to call upon him, consequently we were mournful. Thick-coming
fancies brooded in our brain&mdash;all things conspired against us; the
day was damp and wretched&mdash;the church-bells emulated each other in
announcing the mortalities of earth&rsquo;s bipeds&mdash;each
<em>toll&rsquo;d</em> its tale of death. We thought upon our &ldquo;absent
friend.&rdquo; A funeral approached. We were still more gloomy. Could it
be his? if so, what were his thoughts? Could ghosts but speak, what would
he say? The coffin was coeval with us&mdash;sheets were rubicund compared
to our cheeks. A low deep voice sounded from its very bowels&mdash;the
words were addressed to us&mdash;they were, &ldquo;Take no notice;
it&rsquo;s the first time; it will soon be over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it?&rdquo; we groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m glad you know me. I&rsquo;ll tell you more when I
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious powers! do you expect to return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly! We&rsquo;ll have a screw together yet! There&rsquo;s
room for us both in my place. I&rsquo;ll make you comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold perspiration streamed from us. Was there ever anything so
awful! Here was an unhappy subject threatening to call and see us at
night, and then screw us down and make us comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo; exclaimed the dead again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; we vociferated with fearful energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let it alone; I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have cut me
now; but wait till I show you my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horror of horrors!&mdash;the pall moved&mdash;a long white face peered
from it. We gasped for breath, and only felt new life when we recognised
our uncle Job Bucket, as the author of the conversation, and one of the
bearers of the coffin! He had turned mute!&mdash;but that was a
failure&mdash;no one ever died in his parish after his adopting that
profession!</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>He has been seen once since in the backwoods of America. His fate
seemed still to follow him, and his good temper appeared
immortal&mdash;his situation was more peculiar than pleasant. He was
seated on a log, three hundred miles from any civilised habitation,
smiling blandly at a broken axe (his only one), the half of which was
tightly grasped in his right hand, pointing to the truant iron in the
trunk of a huge tree, the first of a thriving forest of fifty acres he
purposed felling; and, thus occupied, a solitary traveller passed our
uncle Job Bucket, serene as the melting sunshine, and thoughtless as the
wild insect that sported round the owner &ldquo;of the lightest of light
hearts.&rdquo;&mdash;PEACE BE WITH HIM.</p>
<p class="rgt">FUSBOS.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.</h3>
<p>A gentleman of the name of Stuckey has discovered a new filtering
process, by which &ldquo;a stream from a most impure source may be
rendered perfectly translucent and fit for all purposes.&rdquo; In the
name of our rights and liberties! in the name of Judy and our country! we
call upon the proper authorities to have this invaluable apparatus erected
in the lobby of the House of Commons, and so, by compelling every member
to submit to the operation of filtration, cleanse the house from its
present accumulation of corruption, though we defy Stuckey himself to give
it <em>brightness</em>.</p>

<h2>FINE ARTS.</h2>
<h3>EXTERNAL EXHIBITIONS.</h3>
<p>Under this head it is our intention, from time to time, to revert to
numberless free exhibitions, which, in this advancement-of-education age,
have been magnanimously founded with a desire to inculcate a knowledge of,
and disseminate, by these liberal means, an increased taste for the arts
in this vast metropolis. We commence not with any feelings of favouritism,
nor in any order of ability, our pleasures being too numerously divided to
be able to settle as to which ought to be No. 1, but because it is
necessary to commence&mdash;consequently we would wish to settle down in
company with the amiable reader in front of a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop in
the Regent Circus, Piccadilly; and as the principal attractions glare upon
the astonishment of the spectators from the south window, it is there in
imagination that we are irresistibly fixed. Before we dilate upon the
delicious peculiarities of the exhibition, we deem it absolutely a matter
of justice to the noble-hearted patriot who, imitative of the Greeks and
Athenians of old, who gave the porticoes of their public buildings, and
other convenient spots, for the display of their artists&rsquo;
productions, has most generously appropriated the chief space of his shop
front to the use and advantage of the painter, and has thus set a bright
example to the high-minded havannah merchants and contractors for cubas
and c&rsquo;naster, which we trust will not be suffered to pass unobserved
by them.</p>
<p>The principal feature, or, rather mass of features, which enchain the
beholder, is a whole-length portrait of a gentleman (<em>par
excellence</em>) seated in a luxuriating, Whitechapel style of ease, the
envy, we venture to affirm, of every omnibus cad and coachman, whose
loiterings near this spot afford them occasional peeps at him. He is most
decidedly the greatest cigar in the shop&mdash;not only the mildest, if
his countenance deceive us not, but evidently the most full-flavoured. The
artist has, moreover, by some extraordinary adaptation or strange
coincidence, made him typical of the locality&mdash;we allude to the
Bull-and-Mouth&mdash;seated at a table evidently made and garnished for
the article. The said gentleman herein depicted is in the act of drinking
his own health, or that of &ldquo;all absent friends,&rdquo; probably
coupling with it some little compliment to a favourite dog, one of the
true Regent-street-and-pink-ribbon breed, who appears to be paying
suitable attention. A huge pine-apple on the table, and a champagne cork
or two upon the ground, contribute a gallant air of reckless expenditure
to this spirited work. In reference to the artistic qualities, it gives us
immoderate satisfaction to state that the whole is conceived and executed
with that characteristic attention so observable in the works of this
master<sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote">3</span><span class="sidenote">3.
We have forgotten the artist&rsquo;s name&mdash;perhaps never knew it; but
we believe it is the same gentleman who painted the great author of
&ldquo;Jack Sheppard.&rdquo;</span>, and that the fruit-knife, fork,
cork-screw, decanter, and chiaro-scuro (as the critic of the <em>Art
Union</em> would have it), are truly excellent. The only drawback upon the
originality of the subject is the handkerchief on the knee, which
(although painted as vigorously as any other portion of the picture) we do
not strictly approve of, inasmuch as it may, with the utmost impartiality,
be assumed as an imitation of Sir Thomas Lawrence&rsquo;s portrait of
George the Fourth; nevertheless, we in part excuse this, from the known
difficulty attendant upon the representation of a gentleman seated in
enjoyment, and parading his bandana, without associating it with a
veritable footman, who, upon the occasion of his &ldquo;Sunday out,&rdquo;
may, perchance, be seen in one of the front lower tenements in
Belgrave-square, or some such <em>locale</em>, paying violent attentions
to the housemaid, and the hot toast, decorated with the order of the
handkerchief, to preserve his crimson plush in all its glowing purity. We
cannot take leave of this interesting work without declaring our opinion
that the composition (of the frame) is highly creditable.</p>
<p>Placed on the right of the last-mentioned work of art, is a
representation of a young lady, as seen when presenting a full-blown
flower to a favourite parrot. There is a delicate simplicity in the
attitude and expression of the damsel, which, though you fail to discover
the like in the tortuous figures of Taglioni or Cerito, we have often
observed in the conduct of ladies many years in the seniority of the one
under notice, who, ever mindful of the idol of their thoughts and
affections&mdash;a feline companion&mdash;may be seen carrying a precious
morsel, safely skewered, in advance of them; this gentleness the artist
has been careful to retain to eminent success. We are, nevertheless,
woefully at a loss to divine what the allegory can possibly be (for as
such we view it), what the analogy between a pretty poll and a
pol-yanthus. We are unlearned in the language of flowers, or, perhaps,
might probe the mystery by a little floral discussion. We are, however,
compelled to leave it to the noble order of freemasons, and shall
therefore wait patiently an opportunity of communicating with his Royal
Highness the Duke of Sussex. In the meantime we shall not he silent upon
the remaining qualities of the work as a general whole&mdash;the young
lady&mdash;the parrot&mdash;the polyanthus, and the chiaro-scuro, are as
excellent as usual in this our most amusing painter&rsquo;s
productions.</p>
<p>As a pendant to this, we are favoured with the portrait of a young
gentleman upon a half-holiday&mdash;and, equipped with cricket means, his
dexter-hand grasps his favourite bat, whilst the left arm gracefully
encircles a hat, in which is seductively shown a genuine
&ldquo;Duke.&rdquo; The sentiment of this picture is unparalleled, and to
the young hero of any parish eleven is given a stern expression of
Lord&rsquo;s Marylebone ground. We can already (aided by perspective and
imagination) see him before a future generation of cricketers,
&ldquo;shoulder his bat, and show how games were won.&rdquo; The bat is
well drawn and coloured with much truth, and with that strict observance
of harmony which is so characteristic of the excellences of art. The
artist has felicitously blended the tone and character of the bat with
that of the young gentleman&rsquo;s head. As to the ball, we do not
recollect ever to have seen one in the works of any of the old masters so
true to nature. In conclusion, the buttons on the jacket, and the
button-holes, companions thereto, would baffle the criticism of the most
hyper-fastidious stab-rag; and the shirt collar, with every other
detail&mdash;never forgetting the chiaro-scuro&mdash;are equal to any of
the preceding.</p>

<h2>CURIOUS COINCIDENCE.</h2>
<p>We had prepared an announcement of certain theatricals extraordinary,
with which we had intended to favour the public, when the following bill
reached us. We feel that its contents partake so strongly of what we had
heretofore conceived the exclusive character of PUNCH, that to avoid the
charge of plagiarism, as well as to prevent any confusion of interests, we
have resolved to give insertion to both.</p>
<p>As PUNCH is above all petty rivalry, we accord our
<em>collaborateurs</em> the preference.</p>

<h4>ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC.</h4>
<p>The generous National feelings of the British Public are proverbially
interested in every endeavour to obtain &ldquo;a Free Stage and Fair
Play.&rdquo; The Council of the Dramatic Authors&rsquo; Theatre seek to
achieve both, for every English Living Dramatist. Compelled, by the state
of the <em>Law</em>, to present on the Stage a high Tragic Composition IN
AN IRREGULAR FORM (in effecting which, nevertheless, regard has been had
to those elements of human nature, which must constitute the essential
principles of every genuine Dramatic Production), they hope for such kind
consideration as may be due to a work brought forward in obedient
accordance with the regulations of <em>Acts of Parliament</em>, though
labouring thereby under some consequent difficulties; the <em>Law</em> for
the Small Theatres Royal, and the <em>Law</em> for the Large Theatres
Royal, <em>not</em> being one and the same <em>Law</em>. If, by these
efforts, a beneficial alteration in such Law, which presses so fatally on
Dramatic Genius, and which militates against the revival of the highest
class of Drama, should be effected, they feel assured that the Public will
Participate in their Triumph.</p>
<p>On THURSDAY, the 26th of AUGUST, will be presented, for the First
Time,</p>

<h2>THE WHIGS&rsquo; LAST DYING SPEECH, AS DELIVERED BY THE QUEEN</h2>
<p>It is with no common pride that PUNCH avails himself of the opportunity
presented to him, from sources exclusively his own, of laying before his
readers a copy of the original draft of the Speech decided upon at a late
Cabinet Council. There is a novelty about it which pre-eminently
distinguishes it from all preceding orations from the throne or the
woolsack, for it has a purpose, and evinces much kind consideration on the
part of the Sovereign, in rendering this monody on departed Whiggism as
grateful as possible to its surviving friends and admirers.</p>
<p>There is much of the eulogistic fervour of George Robins, combined with
the rich poetic feeling of Mechi, running throughout the oration. Indeed,
it remained for the Whigs to add this crowning triumph to their policy;
for who but Melbourne and Co. would have conceived the happy idea of
converting the mouth of the monarch into an organ for puffing, and
transforming Majesty itself into a <em>National Advertiser</em>?</p>
<h3>THE QUEEN&rsquo;S SPEECH.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
<p>I have the satisfaction to inform you, that, through the invaluable
policy of my present talented and highly disinterested advisers, I
continue to receive from foreign powers assurances of their amicable
disposition towards, and unbounded respect for, my elegant and enlightened
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and of their earnest desire to
remain on terms of friendship with the rest of my gifted, liberal, and
amiable Cabinet.</p>
<p>The posture of affairs in China is certainly not of the most pacific
character, but I have the assurance of my infallible Privy Council, and of
that profound statesman my Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in
particular, that the present disagreement arises entirely from the
barbarous character of the Chinese, and their determined opposition to the
progress of temperance in this happy country.</p>
<p>I have also the satisfaction to inform you, that, by the acute
diplomatic skill of my never-to-be-sufficiently-eulogised Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, that, after innumerable and complicated
negotiations, he has at length succeeded in seducing his Majesty the King
of the French to render to England the tardy justice of commemorating, by
a <em>f&ecirc;te</em> and inauguration at Boulogne, the disinclination of
the French, at a former period, to invade the British dominions.</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,</p>
<p>I have directed the <em>estimates for the next fortnight</em> to be
laid before you, which, I am happy to inform you, will be amply sufficient
for the exigencies of my <em>present</em> disinterested advisers.</p>
<p>The unequalled fiscal and arithmetical talents of my Chancellor of the
Exchequer have, by the most rigid economy, succeeded in reducing the
revenue very considerably below the actual expenditure of the state.</p>
<p>MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
<p>Measures will be speedily submitted to you for carrying out the
admirable plans of my Secretary of State for the Colonial Department, and
the brilliant author of &ldquo;Don Carlos,&rdquo; for the prevention of
apoplexy among paupers, and the reduction of the present extravagant
dietary of the Unions.</p>
<p>I have the gratification to announce that a commission is in progress,
by which it is proposed by my <em>non</em>-patronage Ministers to call
into requisition the talents of several literary gentlemen&mdash;all
intimate friends or relations of my deeply erudite and profoundly
philosophic Secretary of State for the Home Department, and author of
&ldquo;Yes and No,&rdquo; (three vols. Colburn) for the purpose of
extending the knowledge of reading and writing, and the encouragement of
circulating libraries all over the kingdom.</p>
<p>My consistent and uncompromising Secretary of State for the Colonies,
having, since the publication of his spirited &ldquo;Essays by a gentleman
who has lately left his lodgings,&rdquo; totally changed his opinions on
the subject of the Corn Laws, a measure is in the course of preparation
with a view to the repeal of those laws, and the continuance in office of
my invaluable, tenacious, and incomparable ministry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CAUTION.&mdash;We have just heard from a friend in Somerset House, that
it is the intention of the Commissioners of Stamps, from the glaring puffs
embodied in the above speech, to proceed for the advertisement duty
against all newspapers in which it is inserted. For ourselves, we will
cheerfully pay.</p>

<p>OLD GLORY&rsquo;S WHIG TOP-BOOTS REFUSING TO CARRY HIM TO THE DINNER TO
CAPTAIN ROUS.</p>
</div>
<p>Such, we are credibly assured, was the determination of these liberal
and enlightened leathers. They had heard frequent whispers of a general
indisposition on the part of all lovers of consistency to stand in their
master&rsquo;s shoes, and taking the insult to themselves, they lately
came to the resolution of cutting the connexion. They felt that his
liberality and his boots were all that constituted the idea of Burdett;
and now that he had forsaken his old party and joined Peel&rsquo;s, the
&ldquo;tops&rdquo; magnanimously decided to forsake him, and force him to
take to&mdash;Wellingtons. We have been favoured with a report of the
conversation that took place upon the occasion, and may perhaps indulge
our readers with a copy of it next week.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we beg to subjoin a few lines, suggested by the
circumstance of Burdett taking the chair at Rous&rsquo;s feast, which
strongly remind us of Byron&rsquo;s Vision of Belshazzar.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Burdett was in the chair&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The Tories throng&rsquo;d the hall&mdash;</p>
<p>A thousand lamps were there,</p>
<p class="i2">O&rsquo;er that mad festival.</p>
<p>His crystal cup contain&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="i2">The grape-blood of the Rhine;</p>
<p>Draught after draught he drain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="i2">To drown his thoughts in wine.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>In that same hour and hall</p>
<p class="i2">A shade like &ldquo;Glory&rdquo; came,</p>
<p>And wrote upon the wall</p>
<p class="i2">The records of his shame.</p>
<p>And at its fingers traced</p>
<p class="i2">The words, as with a wand,</p>
<p>The traitorous and debased</p>
<p class="i2">Upraised his palsied hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And in his chair he shook,</p>
<p class="i2">And could no more rejoice;</p>
<p>All bloodless wax&rsquo;d his look,</p>
<p class="i2">And tremulous his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What words are those appear,</p>
<p class="i2">To mar my fancied mirth!</p>
<p>What bringeth &lsquo;Glory&rsquo; here</p>
<p class="i2">To tell of faded worth?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE LORD HIGH INQUISITOR PUNCH.</h2>
<h3>PAT V. THE WHIG JUSTICE COMPANY.</h3>
<p>This is a cause of thorough orthodox equity standing, having commenced
before the time of legal memory, with every prospect of obtaining a final
decree on its merits somewhere about the next Greek Kalends. In the
present term,</p>
<p>COUNSELLOR BAYWIG moved, on the part of the plaintiff, who sues <em>in
form&acirc; pauperis</em>, for an injunction to restrain the Whig Justice
Company from setting a hungry Scotchman&mdash;one of their own creatures,
without local or professional knowledge&mdash;over the lands of which the
plaintiff is the legal, though unfortunately not the beneficial owner, as
keeper and head manager thereof, to the gross wrong of the tenants, the
depreciation of the lands themselves, the further reduction of the funds
standing in the name of the cause, the insult to the feelings and the
disregard of the rights of gentlemen living on the estate, and perfectly
acquainted with its management; and finally, to an unblushing and
barefaced denial of justice to all parties. The learned counsel proceeded
to state, that the company, in order to make an excuse for thus saddling
the impoverished estates with an additional incubus, had committed a
double wrong, by forcing from the office a man eminently qualified to
discharge its functions&mdash;who had lived and grown white with
honourable years in the actual discharge of these functions&mdash;and by
thrusting into his place their own needy retainer, who, instead of being
the propounder of the laws which govern the estates, would be merely the
apprentice to learn them; and this too at a time when the company was on
the eve of bankruptcy, and when the possession which they had usurped so
long was about to pass into the hands of their official assignees.</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;What authorities can you cite for this
application?</p>
<p>COUNSELLOR BAYWIG.&mdash;My lord, I fear the cases are, on the whole,
rather adverse to us. Men have, undoubtedly, been chosen to administer the
laws of this fine estate, and to guard it from waste, who have studied its
customs, been thoroughly learned in its statistics, and interested, by
blood and connexion, in its prosperity; but this number is very small.
However, when injustice of the most grievous kind is manifest, it should
not be continued merely because it is the custom, or because it is an
&ldquo;old institution of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;I am quite astonished at your broaching
such abominable doctrines here, sir. You a lawyer, and yet talk of justice
in a Court of Equity! By Bacon, Blackstone, and Eldon, &lsquo;tis
marvellous! Mr. Baywig, if you proceed, I shall feel it my duty to commit
you for a contempt of court.</p>
<p>COUNSELLOR BAYWIG.&mdash;My lord, in that case I decline the honour of
addressing your lordship further; but certainly my poor client is wronged
in his land, in himself, and in his kindred. It is shocking personal
insult added to terrible pecuniary punishment.</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;<em>Serve</em> him right! We dismiss the
application with costs.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE ADVANTAGES OF STYLE.</h3>
<p>Some of the uninitiated in the art and mystery of book-making conceive
the chief tax must be upon the compiler&rsquo;s brain. We give the
following as a direct proof to the contrary&mdash;one that has the
authority of Lord Hamlet, who summed the matter up in three</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Words! Words! Words!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In one column we give a common-place household and familiar
term&mdash;in the other we render it into the true Bulwerian
phraseology:</p>

white-washed daughters.</td>

<hr />
<p>From the nobleman who is selected to move the address in the House of
Lords, it would seem that the Whigs, tired of any further experiments in
turning their coats, are about to try what effect they can produce with an
<em>old Spencer</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the weather is to decide the question of the corn-laws, the rains
that have lately fallen may be called, with truth, the <em>reins</em> of
government.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SPORTING IN DOWNING STREET.</h3>
<h5>&ldquo;COME OUT&mdash;WILL YOU!&rdquo;</h5>
<p>The extraordinary attachment which the Whigs have displayed for office
has been almost without parallel in the history of ministerial fidelity.
Zoologists talk of the local affection of cats, but in what animal shall
we discover such a strong love of place as in the present government? Lord
John is a very badger in the courageous manner in which he has resisted
the repeated attacks of the Tory terriers. The odds, however, are too
great for even <em>his</em> powers of defence; he has given some of the
most forward of the curs who have tried to drag him from his burrow some
shrewd bites and scratches that they will not forget in a hurry; but,
overpowered by numbers, he must &ldquo;come out&rdquo; at last, and yield
the victory to his numerous persecutors, who will, no doubt, plume
themselves upon their dexterity at drawing a badger.</p>
<hr />
<h3>PUNCH&rsquo;S EXTRA DRAMATIC INTELLIGENCE</h3>
<h5>(BY THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE OBSERVER.)</h5>
<p>The dramatic world has been in a state of bustle all the week, and
parties are going about declaring&mdash;not that we put any faith in what
they say&mdash;that Macready has already given a large sum for a
manuscript. If he has done this, we think he is much to blame, unless he
has very good reasons, as he most likely has, for doing so; and if such is
the case, though we doubt the policy of the step, there can be no question
of his having acted very properly in taking it. His lease begins in
October, when, it is said, he will certainly open, if he can; but, as he
positively cannot, the reports of his opening are rather premature, to say
the least of them. For our parts, we never think of putting any credit in
what we hear, but we give everything just as it reaches us.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE MONEY MARKET</h3>
<p>Tin is twopence a hundredweight dearer at Hamburgh than at Paris, which
gives an exchange of 247 mille in favour of the latter capital.</p>
<p>A good deal of conversation has been excited by a report of its being
intended by some parties in the City to establish a Bank of Issue upon
equitable principles. The plan is a novel one, for there is to be no
capital actually subscribed, it being expected that sufficient assets will
be derived from the depositors. Shares are to be issued, to which a
nominal price will be attached, and a dividend is to be declared
immediately.</p>
<p>The association for supplying London with periwinkles does not progress
very rapidly. A wharf has been taken; but nothing more has been done,
which is, we believe, caused by the difficulty found in dealing with
existing interests.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SIGNS OF THE TIMES.</h3>
<p>The Tories are coming into office, and the Parliament House is
surrounded with scaffolds!</p>
<hr />
<h3>TO BAKERS AND FISHMONGERS.</h3>
<p>Want places, in either of the above lines, three highly practical and
experienced hands, fully capable and highly accomplished in the arduous
duties of &ldquo;looking after any quantity of loaves and fishes.&rdquo; A
ten years&rsquo; character can be produced from their last places, which
they leave because the concern is for the present disposed of to persons
equally capable. No objection to look after the till. Wages not so much an
object as an extensive trade, the applicants being desirous of keeping
their hands in. Apply to Messrs. Russell, Melbourne, and Palmerston,

<p>&ldquo;It is very odd,&rdquo; said Sergeant Channell to Thessiger,
&ldquo;that Tindal should have decided against me on that point of law
which, to me, seemed as plain as A B C.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied
Thessiger, &ldquo;but of what use is it that it should have been A B C to
you, if the judge was determined to be D E F to it?&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>CLEVER ROGUES.</h3>
<p>The <em>Belfast Vindicator</em> has a story of a sailor who pledged a
sixpence for threepence, having it described on the duplicate ticket as
&ldquo;a piece of silver plate of beautiful workmanship,&rdquo; by which
means he disposed of the ticket for two-and-sixpence. The Tories are so
struck with this display of congenial roguery, that they intend pawning
their &ldquo;BOB,&rdquo; and having him described as &ldquo;a rare piece
of vertu(e) <em>premi&egrave;re qualit&eacute;</em>&rdquo; in the
expectation of securing a <em>crown</em> by it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>MUNTZ ON THE STATE OF THE CROPS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Muntz requests us to state, in answer to numerous inquiries as to
the motives which induce him to cultivate his beard, that he is actuated
purely by a spirit of economy, having, for the last few years, <em>grown
his own mattresses</em>, a practice which he earnestly recommends to the
attention of all prudent and hirsute individuals. He finds, by experience,
that nine square inches of chin will produce, on an average, about a sofa
per annum. The whiskers, if properly attended to, may be made to yield
about an easy chair in the same space of time; whilst luxuriant
moustachios will give a pair of anti-rheumatic attrition gloves every six
months. Mr. M. recommends, as the best mode of cultivation for barren
soils, to plough with a cat&rsquo;s-paw, and manure with Macassar.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Earl of Stair has been created Lord Oxenford. Theodore Hook thinks
that the more appropriate title for a <em>Stair</em>, in raising him a
step higher, would have been Lord <em>Landing-place</em>, or Viscount
<em>Bannister</em>.</p>

<h2>LORD MELBOURNE&rsquo;S LETTER-BAG.</h2>
<p>The Augean task of cleansing the Treasury has commenced, and brooms and
scrubbing-brushes are at a premium&mdash;a little anticipative, it is
true, of the approaching turn-out; but the dilatory idleness and
muddle-headed confusion of those who will soon be termed its late
occupiers, rendered this a work of absolute time and labour. That the
change in office had long been expected, is evident from the number of
hoards discovered, which the unfortunate <em>employ&eacute;s</em> had
saved up against the rainy day arrived. The routing-out of this
conglomeration was only equalled in trouble by the removal of the birdlime
with which the various benches were covered, and which adhered with most
pertinacious obstinacy, in spite of every effort to get rid of it. From
one of the wicker baskets used for the purpose of receiving the torn-up
letters and documents, the following papers were extracted. We contrived
to match the pieces together, and have succeeded tolerably well in forming
some connected epistles from the disjointed fragments. We offer no
comment, but allow them to speak for themselves. They are selected at
random from dozens of others, with which the poor man must have been
overwhelmed during the past two months:&mdash;</p>

nevertheless, feel delighted in the society of a man of Lord

<h3>MATERNAL SOLICITUDE.</h3>
<p>The business habits of her gracious Majesty have long been the theme of
admiration with her loving subjects. A further proof of her attention to
general affairs, and consideration for the accidents of the future, has
occurred lately. The lodge at Frogmore, which was, during the lifetime of
Queen Charlotte, an out-of-town nursery for little highnesses, has been
constructed (by command of the Queen) into a Royal Eccalleobion for a
similar purpose.</p>

<h2>WIT WITHOUT MONEY:</h2>
<h3>OR, HOW TO LIVE UPON NOTHING.</h3>
<h4>BY VAMPYRE HORSELEECH, ESQ</h4>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A clever fellow, that Horseleech!&rdquo; &ldquo;When Vampyre is
once drawn out, what a great creature it is!&rdquo; These, and similar
ecstatic eulogiums, have I frequently heard murmured forth from muzzy
mouths into tinged and tingling ears, as I have been leaving a company of
choice spirits. There never was a greater mistake. Horseleech, to be
candid, far from being a clever fellow, is one of the most barren rascals
on record. Vampyre, whether drawn out or held in, is a poor creature, not
a great creature&mdash;opaque, not luminous&mdash;in a word, by nature, a
very dull dog indeed.</p>
<p>But you see the necessity of appearing otherwise.&mdash;Hunger may be
said to be a moral Mechi, which invents a strop upon which the bluntest
wits are sharpened to admiration. Believe me, by industry and
perseverance&mdash;which necessity will inevitably superinduce&mdash;the
most dreary dullard that ever carried timber between his shoulders in the
shape of a head, may speedily convert himself into a seeming
Sheridan&mdash;a substitutional Sydney Smith&mdash;a second Sam Rogers,
without the drawback of having written Jacqueline.</p>
<p>Take it for granted that no professed diner-out ever possessed a
particle of native wit. His stock-in-trade, like that of Field-lane
chapmen, is all plunder. Not a joke issues from his mouth, but has shaken
sides long since quiescent. Whoso would be a diner-out must do
likewise.</p>
<p>The real diner-out is he whose card-rack or mantelpiece (I was going to
say groans, but) laughingly rejoices in respectful well-worded invitations
to luxuriously-appointed tables. I count not him, hapless wretch! as one
who, singling out &ldquo;a friend,&rdquo; drops in just at pudding-time,
and ravens horrible remnants of last Tuesday&rsquo;s joint, cognizant of
curses in the throat of his host, and of intensest sable on the brows of
his hostess. No struggle there, on the part of the children, &ldquo;to
share the good man&rsquo;s knee;&rdquo; but protruded eyes, round as
spectacles, and almost as large, fixed alternately upon his flushed face
and that absorbing epigastrium which is making their miserable flesh-pot
to wane most wretchedly.</p>
<p>To be jocose is not the sole requisite of him who would fain be a
universal diner-out. Lively with the light&mdash;airy with the
sparkling&mdash;brilliant with the blithe, he must also be grave with the
serious&mdash;heavy with the profound&mdash;solemn with the stupid. He
must be able to snivel with the sentimental&mdash;to condole with the
afflicted&mdash;to prove with the practical&mdash;to be a theorist with
the speculative.</p>
<p>To be jocose is his most valuable acquisition. As there is a tradition
that birds may be caught by sprinkling salt upon their tails, so the best
and the most numerous dinners are secured by a judicious management of
Attic salt.</p>
<p>I fear me that the works of Josephus, and of his imitators&mdash;of
that Joseph and his brethren, I mean, whom a friend of mine calls
&ldquo;<em>The</em> Miller and his men&rdquo;&mdash;I fear me, I say, that
these are well-nigh exhausted. Yet I have known very ancient jokes turned
with advantage, so as to look almost equal to new. But this requires long
practice, ere the final skill be attained.</p>
<p>Etherege, Sedley, Wycherley, and Vanbrugh are very little read, and
were pretty fellows in their day; I think they may be safely consulted,
and rendered available. But, have a care. Be sure you mingle some of your
own dulness with their brighter matter, or you will overshoot the mark.
You will be too witty&mdash;a fatal error. True wits eat no dinners, save
of their own providing; and, depend upon it, it is not their wit that will
now-a-days get them their dinner. True wits are feared, not fed.</p>
<p>When you tell an anecdote, never ascribe it to a man well known. The
time is gone by for dwelling upon&mdash;&ldquo;Dean Swift
said&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Quin, the actor, remarked&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
facetious Foote was once&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That reminds me of what
Sheridan&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! ha! Sydney Smith was dining the other day
with&rdquo;&mdash;and the like. Your ha! ha!&mdash;especially should it
precede the name of Sam Rogers&mdash;would inevitably cost you a hecatomb
of dinners. It would be changed into oh! oh! too surely, and too soon.
<em>Verbum sat</em>.</p>
<p>I would have you be careful to <em>sort</em> your pleasantries. Your
soup jokes (never hazard that one about Marshal <em>Turenne</em>, it is
really <em>too</em> ancient,) your fish, your flesh, your fowl
jests&mdash;your side-shakers for the side dishes&mdash;your puns for the
pastry&mdash;your after-dinner excruciators.</p>
<p>Sometimes, from negligence (but be not negligent) or ill-luck, which is
unavoidable, and attends the best directed efforts, you sit down to table
with your stock ill arranged or incomplete, or of an inferior quality.
Your object is to make men laugh. It must be done. I have known a pathetic
passage, quoted timely and with a happy emphasis from a popular
novel&mdash;say, &ldquo;Alice, or the Mysteries&rdquo;&mdash;I have known
it, I say, do more execution upon the congregated amount of midriff, than
the best joke of the evening. (There is one passage in that
&ldquo;thrilling&rdquo; performance, where Alice, overjoyed that her lover
is restored to her, is represented as frisking about him like a dog around
his long-absent proprietor, which, whenever I have taken it in hand, has
been rewarded with the most vociferous and gleesome laughter.)</p>
<p>And this reminds me that I should say a word about laughers. I know not
whether it be prudent to come to terms with any man, however stentorian
his lungs, or flexible his facial organs, with a view to engage him as a
cachinnatory machine. A confederate may become a traitor&mdash;a rival he
is pretty certain of becoming. Besides, strive as you may, you can never
secure an altogether unexceptionable individual&mdash;one who will
&ldquo;go the whole hyaena,&rdquo; and be at the same time the entire
jackal. If he once start &ldquo;lion&rdquo; on his own account, furnished
with your original roar, with which you yourself have supplied him,
good-bye to your supremacy. &ldquo;Farewell, my trim-built
wherry&rdquo;&mdash;he is in the same boat only to capsise you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first lion thinks the last a bore,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and rightly so thinks. No; the best and safest plan is to work out your
own ends, independent of aid which at best is foreign, and is likely to be
formidable.</p>
<p>I may perhaps resume this subject more at large at a future time. My
space at present is limited, but I feel I have hardly as yet entered upon
the subject.</p>

<h3>CHELSEA.</h3>
<h4>(From our own Correspondent.)</h4>
<p>This delightful watering-place is filling rapidly. The steam-boats
bring down hundreds every day, and in the evening take them all back
again. Mr. Jones has engaged a lodging for the week, and other families
are spoken of. A ball is also talked about; but it is not yet settled who
is to give it, nor where it is to be given. The promenading along the
wooden pier is very general at the leaving of the packets, and on their
arrival a great number of persons pass over it. There are whispers of a
band being engaged for the season; but, as there will not be room on the
pier for more than one musician, it has been suggested to negotiate with
the talented artist who plays the drum with his knee, the cymbals with his
elbow, the triangle with his shoulder, the bells with this head, and the
Pan&rsquo;s pipes with his mouth&mdash;thus uniting the powers of a full
orchestra with the compactness of an individual. An immense number of
Margate slippers and donkeys have been imported within the last few days,
and there is every probability of this pretty little peninsula becoming a
formidable rival to the old-established watering-places.</p>

<h2>THE DRAMA.</h2>
<h3>FOREIGN AFFAIRS,</h3>
<h4>OR, THE COURT OF QUEEN ANNE.</h4>
<p>Perhaps it was the fashion at the court of Queen Anne, for young
gentlemen who had attained the age of sixteen to marry and be given in
marriage. At all events, some conjecture of the sort is necessary to make
the plot of the piece we are noticing somewhat probable&mdash;that being
the precise circumstance upon which it hinges. The <em>Count St.
Louis</em>, a youthful <em>attach&eacute;</em> of the French embassy,
becomes attached, by a marriage contract, to <em>Lady Bell</em>, a maid of
honour to Queen Anne. The husband at sixteen, of a wife quite nineteen,
would, according to the natural course of things, be very considerably
hen-pecked; and <em>St. Louis</em>, foreseeing this, determines to begin.
Well, he insists upon having &ldquo;article five&rdquo; of the marriage
contract cancelled; for, by this stipulation, he is to be separated from
his wife, on the evening of the ceremony (which fast approaches), for five
years. He storms, swears, and is laughed at; somebody sends him a wedding
present of sugar-plums&mdash;everybody calls him a boy, and makes merry at
his expense&mdash;the wife treats him with contempt, and plays the
scornful. The hobble-de-hoy husband, fired with indignation, determines to
prove himself a man.</p>
<p>At the court of Queen Anne this seems to have been an easy matter.
<em>St. Louis</em> writes love-letters to several maids of honour and to a
citizen&rsquo;s wife, finishing the first act by invading the private
apartments of the maiden ladies belonging to the court of the chaste Queen
Anne.</p>
<p>The second act discovers him confined to his apartments by order of the
Queen, having amused himself, while the intrigues begun by the
love-letters are hatching, by running into debt, and being surrounded by
duns. The intrigues are not long in coming to a head, for two ladies visit
him separately in secret, and allow themselves to be hid in those
never-failing adjuncts to a piece of dramatic intrigue&mdash;a couple of
closets, which are used exactly in the same manner in &ldquo;Foreign
Affairs,&rdquo; as in all the farces within the memory of
man&mdash;<em>ex. gr.</em>:&mdash;The hero is alone; one lady enters
cautiously. A tender interchange of sentiment ensues&mdash;a noise is
heard, and the lady screams. &ldquo;Ah! that closet!&rdquo; Into which
exit lady. Then enter lady No. 2. A second interchange of tender
things&mdash;another noise behind. &ldquo;No escape?&rdquo; &ldquo;None!
and yet, happy thought, that closet.&rdquo; Exit lady No. 2, into closet
No. 2.</p>
<p>This is exactly as it happens in &ldquo;Foreign Affairs.&rdquo; The
second noise is made by the husband of one of the concealed ladies, and
the lover of the other. Here, out of the old &ldquo;closet&rdquo;
materials, the dramatist has worked up one of the best situations&mdash;to
use an actor&rsquo;s word&mdash;we ever remember to have witnessed. It
cannot be described; but it is really worth all the money to go and see
it. Let our readers do so. The &ldquo;Affairs&rdquo; end by the boy
fighting a couple of duels with the injured men; and thus, crowning the
proof of his manhood, gets his wife to tolerate&mdash;to love him.</p>
<p>The piece was, as it deserved to be, highly successful; it was
admirably acted by Mr. Webster as one of the injured lovers&mdash;Mr.
Strickland and Mrs. Stirling, as a vulgar citizen and citizeness&mdash;by
Miss P. Horton as <em>Lady Bell</em>&mdash;and even by a Mr. Clarke, who
played a very small part&mdash;that of a barber&mdash;with great skill.
Lastly, Madlle. Celeste, as the hero, acquitted herself to admiration. We
suppose the farce is called &ldquo;Foreign Affairs&rdquo; out of
compliment to this lady, who is the only &ldquo;Foreign Affair&rdquo; we
could discover in the whole piece, if we except that it is translated from
the French, which is, strictly, an affair of the author&rsquo;s.</p>
<hr />
<h3>MARY CLIFFORD.</h3>
<p>If, dear readers, you have a taste for refined morality and delicate
sentiment, for chaste acting and spirited dialogue, for scenery painted on
the spot, but like nothing in nature except canvas and colour&mdash;go to
the Victoria and see &ldquo;Mary Clifford.&rdquo; It may, perhaps, startle
you to learn that the incidents are faithfully copied from the
&ldquo;Newgate Calendar,&rdquo; and that the subject is Mother Brownrigg
of apprentice-killing notoriety; but be not alarmed, there is nothing
horrible or revolting in the drama&mdash;it is merely laughable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Clifford, or the foundling apprentice girl,&rdquo; is very
appropriately introduced to the auditor, first outside the gates of that
&ldquo;noble charity-school,&rdquo; taking leave of some of her accidental
companions. Here sympathy is first awakened. Mary is just going out to
&ldquo;place,&rdquo; and instead of saying &ldquo;good bye,&rdquo; which
we have been led to believe is the usual form of farewell amongst
charity-girls, she sings a song with such heart-rending expression, that
everybody cries except the musicians and the audience. To assist in this
lachrymose operation, the girls on the stage are supplied with clean white
aprons&mdash;time out mind a charity-girl&rsquo;s pocket-handkerchief. In
the next scene we are introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Brownrigg&rsquo;s
domestic arrangements, and are made acquainted with their private
characters&mdash;a fine stroke of policy on the part of the author; for
one naturally pities a poor girl who can sing so nicely, and can get the
corners of so many white aprons wetted on leaving her last place, when one
sees into whose hands she is going to fall. The fact is, the whole family
are people of taste&mdash;peculiar, to be sure, and not refined. Mrs. B.
has a taste for starving apprentices&mdash;her son, Mr. Jolin B., for
seducing them&mdash;and Mr. B. longs only for a quiet life, a pot of
porter, and a pipe. Into the bosom of this amiable family Mary Clifford
enters; and we tremble for her virtue and her meals! not, alas, in vain,
for Mr. John is not slow in commencing his gallantries, which are
exceedingly offensive to Mary, seeing that she has already formed a
liaison with a school-fellow, one William Clipson, who happily resides at
the very next door with a baker. During the struggles that ensue she calls
upon her &ldquo;heart&rsquo;s master,&rdquo; the journeyman baker. But
there is another and more terrible invocation. In classic plays they
invoke &ldquo;the gods&rdquo;&mdash;in Catholic I ones, &ldquo;the
saints&rdquo;&mdash;the stage Arab appeals to
&ldquo;Allah&rdquo;&mdash;the light comedian swears &ldquo;by the lord
Harry&rdquo;&mdash;but <em>Mary Clifford</em> adds a new and impressive
invocative to the list. When young Brownrigg attempts to kiss, or his
mother to flog her, she casts her eyes upward, kneels, and placing her
hands together in an attitude of prayer, solemnly calls
upon&mdash;&ldquo;the governors of the Foundling Hospital!!&rdquo; Nothing
can exceed the terrific effect this seems to produce upon her persecutors!
They release her instantly&mdash;they slink back abashed and
trembling&mdash;they hide their diminished heads, and leave their victim a
clear stage for a soliloquy or a song.</p>
<p>We really <em>must</em> stop here, to point out to dramatic authors the
importance of this novel form of conjuration. When the history of
Fauntleroy comes to be dramatised, the lover will, of course, be a
banker&rsquo;s clerk: in the depths of distress and despair into which he
will have to be plunged, a prayer-like appeal to &ldquo;the Governor and
Company of the Bank of England,&rdquo; will, most assuredly, draw tears
from the most insensible audience. The old exclamations of &ldquo;Gracious
powers!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;By heaven,
I swear!&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c., may now be abandoned; and, after
&ldquo;Mary Clifford,&rdquo; Bob Acres&rsquo; tasteful system of swearing
may not only be safely introduced into the tragic drama, but considerably
augmented.</p>
<p>But to return. Dreading lest Miss Mary should really &ldquo;go and
tell&rdquo; the illustrious governors, she is kept a close prisoner, and
finishes the first act by a conspiracy with a fellow-apprentice, and an
attempt to escape.</p>
<p>Mr. Brownrigg, we are informed, carried on business at No. 12,
Fetter-lane, in the oil, paint, pickles, vinegar, plumbing, glazing, and
pepper-line; and, in the next act, a correct view is exhibited of the
exterior of his shop, painted, we are told, from the most indisputable
authorities of the time. Here, in Fetter, lane, the romance of the tale
begins:&mdash;A lady enters, who, being of a communicative disposition,
begins, unasked, unquestioned, to tell the audience a story&mdash;how that
she married in early life&mdash;that her husband was pressed to sea a day
or two after the wedding&mdash;that she in due time became a mother, and
(affectionate creature!) left the dear little pledge at the door of the
Foundling Hospital. That was sixteen years ago. Since then fortune has
smiled, and she wants her baby back again; but on going to the hospital,
says, that they informed her that her daughter has been just &ldquo;put
apprentice&rdquo; in the very house before which she tells the
story&mdash;part of it as great a fib as ever was told; for children once
inside the walls of that &ldquo;noble charity,&rdquo; never know who left
them there; and any attempt to find each other out, by parent or child, is
punished with the instant withdrawal of the omnipotent protection of the
awful &ldquo;governors.&rdquo; This lady, who bears all the romance of the
piece upon her own shoulders, expects to meet her long-lost husband at the
Ship, in Wapping, and instead of seeking her daughter, repairs thither,
having done all the author required, by emptying her budget of fibs.</p>
<p>The next scene is harrowing in the extreme. The bills describe it as
<em>Mrs. Brownrigg&rsquo;s</em> &ldquo;wash-house, kitchen, and
skylight&rdquo;&mdash;the sky-light forming a most impressive object. Poor
<em>Mary Clifford</em> is chained to the floor, her face begrimed, her
dress in rags, and herself exceedingly hungry. Here the heroine describes
the weakness of her body with energy and stentorian eloquence, but is
interrupted by <em>Mr. Clipson</em>, whose face appears framed and glazed
in the broken sky-light. A pathetic dialogue ensues, and the lover swears
he will rescue his mistress, or &ldquo;perish in the attempt,&rdquo;
&ldquo;calling upon Mr. Owen, the parish overseer,&rdquo; to make known
her sufferings. The Ship, in Wapping, is next shown; and <em>Toby
Bensling</em>, alias <em>Richard Clifford</em>, enters to inform his
hearers that he is the missing father of the injured foundling, and has
that moment stepped ashore, after a short voyage, lasting sixteen years!
He is on his way to the &ldquo;Admiralty,&rdquo; to receive some
pay&mdash;the more particularly, we imagine, as they always pay sailors at
Somerset House&mdash;and <em>then</em> to look after his wife. But she
saves him the trouble by entering with <em>Mr. William Clipson</em>. The
usual &ldquo;Whom do I see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Can it
be?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;After so long an absence!&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.,
having been duly uttered and begged to, they all go to see after
<em>Mary</em>, find her in a cupboard in Mrs. B.&rsquo;s back-parlour,
and&mdash;the act-drop falls.</p>
<p>We must confess we approach a description of the third act with
diffidence. Such intense pathos, we feel, demands words of more sombre
sound&mdash;ink of a darker hue, than we can command. The third scene is,
in particular, too extravagantly touching for ordinary nerves to witness.
<em>Mary Clifford</em> is in bed&mdash;French bedstead (especially
selected, perhaps, because such things were not thought of in the days of
Mother Brownrigg) stands exactly in the middle of the stage&mdash;a chest
of drawers is placed behind, and a table on each side, to balance the
picture. The lover leans over the head, the mother sits at the foot, the
father stands at the side: <em>Mary Clifford</em> is insane, with lucid
intervals, and is, moreover, dying. The consequence is, she has all the
talk to herself, which consists of a discourse concerning the great
&ldquo;governors,&rdquo; her cruel mistress, and her naughty young master,
interlarded with insane ejaculations, always considered stage property,
such as, &ldquo;Ah, she comes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, strike me not&mdash;I am
guiltless!&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;Villain! what do you take me
for?&mdash;unhand me!&rdquo; and all that. Then the dying part comes, and
she sees an angel in the flies, and informs it that she is coming soon
(here it is usual for a lady to be removed from the gallery in strong
hysterics), and keeps her word by letting her arm fall upon the
bed-clothes and shutting her eyes, whereupon somebody says that she is
dead, and the prompter whistles for the scene to be changed.</p>
<p>In the last scene, criminal justice takes its course. <em>Mrs.
Brownrigg</em>, having been sentenced to the gallows, is seen in the
