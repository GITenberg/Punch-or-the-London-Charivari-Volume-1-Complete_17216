<h3>A LEGEND OF MY UNCLE&rsquo;S BOOTS.</h3>
<h4><em>In Four Chapters.</em></h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;His name &rsquo;tis proper you should hear,</p>
<p class="i2">&rsquo;Twas Timothy Thady Mulligin:</p>
<p>And whenever he finish&rsquo;d his tumbler of punch,</p>
<p class="i2">He always wished it full agin.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/004-01.png"><img src=

"A pontificating man with his arms outstretched in the shape of a Y." id=
"img004-001" name="img004-001" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">&ldquo;Y</span>ou can have no idea, Jack, how deeply
the loss of those venerated family retainers affected me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle paused. I perceived that his eyes were full, and his tumbler
empty; I therefore thought it advisable to divert his sorrow, by reminding
him of our national proverb, &ldquo;<em>Iss farr doch na
skeal</em><sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1. A drink is better than a
story.</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes glistened with pleasure, as he grasped my
hand, saying, &ldquo;I see, Jack, you are worthy of your name. I was
afraid that school-learning and college would have spoiled your taste for
honest drinking; but the right drop is in you still, my boy. I
mentioned,&rdquo; continued he, resuming the thread of his story,
&ldquo;that my grandfather died, leaving to his heirs the topped boots,
spurs, buckskin-breeches, and red waistcoat; but it is about the
first-mentioned articles I mean especially to speak, as it was mainly
through their respectable appearance that so many excellent matches and
successful negotiations have been concluded by our family. If one of our
cousins was about to wait on his landlord or his sweetheart, if he
meditated taking a farm or a wife, &lsquo;the tops&rsquo; were instantly
brushed up, and put into requisition. Indeed, so fortunate had they been
in all the matrimonial embassies to which they had been attached, that
they acquired the name of &lsquo;the wife-catchers,&rsquo; amongst the
young fellows of our family. Something of the favour they enjoyed in the
eyes of the fair sex should, perhaps, be attributed to the fact, that all
the Duffys were fine strapping fellows, with legs that seemed made for
setting off topped boots to the best advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, years rolled by; the sons of mothers whose hearts had been
won by the irresistible buckism of Shawn Duffy&rsquo;s boots, grew to
maturity, and, in their turn, furbished up &lsquo;the
wife-catchers,&rsquo; when intent upon invading the affections of other
rustic fair ones. At length these invaluable relics descended to me, as
the representative of our family. It was ten years on last Lady-day since
they came into my possession, and I am proud to say, that during that time
the Duffys and &lsquo;the wife-catchers&rsquo; lost nothing of the
reputation they had previously gained, for no less than nineteen marriages
and ninety-six christenings have occurred in our family during the time. I
had every hope, too, that another chalk would have been added to the
matrimonial tally, and that I should have the pleasure of completing the
score before Lent; for, one evening, about four months ago, I received a
note from your cousin Peter, informing me that he intended riding over, on
the following Sunday, to Miss Peggy Haggarty&rsquo;s, for the purpose of
popping the question, and requesting of me the loan of the lucky
&lsquo;wife-catchers&rsquo; for the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not tell you I was delighted to oblige poor Peter, who is
the best fellow and surest shot in the county, and accordingly took down
the boots from their peg in the hall. Through the negligence of the
servant they have been hung up in a damp state, and had become covered
with blue mould. In order to render them decent and comfortable for Peter,
I placed them to dry inside the fender, opposite the fire; then lighting
my pipe, I threw myself back in my chair, and as the fragrant fumes of the
Indian weed curled and wreathed around my head, with half-closed eyes
turned upon the renowned &lsquo;wife-catchers,&rsquo; I indulged in
delightful visions of future weddings and christenings, and recalled, with
a sigh, the many pleasant ones I had witnessed in their
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here my uncle applied the tumbler to his face to conceal his emotion.
&ldquo;I brought to mind,&rdquo; he continued (ordering; in a parenthesis,
another jug of boiling water), &ldquo;I brought to mind the first time I
had myself sported the envied &lsquo;wife-catchers&rsquo; at the
<em>pattron</em> of Moycullen. I was then as wild a blade as any in
Connaught, and the &lsquo;tops&rsquo; were in the prime of their beauty.
In fact, I am not guilty of flattery or egotism in saying, that the girl
who could then turn up her nose at the boots, or their master, must have
been devilish hard to please. But though the hey-day of our youth had
passed, I consoled myself with the reflection that with the help of the
saints, and a pair of new soles, we might yet hold out to marry and bury
three generations to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As these anticipations passed through my mind, I was startled by
a sudden rustling near me. I raised my eyes to discover the cause, and
fancy my surprise when I beheld &lsquo;the wife-catchers,&rsquo; by some
marvellous power, suddenly become animated, gradually elongating and
altering themselves, until they assumed the appearance of a couple of tall
gentlemen clad in black, with extremely sallow countenances; and what was
still more extraordinary, though they possessed separate bodies, their
actions seemed to be governed by a single mind. I stared, and doubtless so
would you, Jack, had you been in my place; but my astonishment was at its
height, when the partners, keeping side by side as closely as the Siamese
twins, stepped gracefully over the fender, and taking a seat directly
opposite me, addressed me in a voice broken by an irrepressible
chuckle&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here we are, old boy. Ugh, ugh, ugh, hoo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I perceive, gentlemen,&rdquo; I replied, rather drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You look a little alarmed&mdash;ugh, ugh, hoo, hoo,
hoo!&rsquo; cried the pair. &lsquo;Excuse our laughter&mdash;hoo! hoo!
hoo! We mean no offence&mdash;none whatever. Ugh, hoo, hoo, hoo! We know
we are somewhat changed in appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assured the transformed &lsquo;tops&rsquo; I was delighted in
being honoured with their company, under any shape; hoped they would make
themselves quite at home, and take a glass with me in the friendly way.
The friends shook their heads simultaneously, declining the offer; and he
whom I had hitherto known as the <em>right</em> foot, said in a grave
voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We feel obliged, sir, but we never take anything but
water; moreover, our business now is to relate to you some of the singular
adventures of our life, convinced, that in your hand they will be given to
the world in three handsome volumes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My curiosity was instantly awakened, and I drew my chair closer
to my communicative friends, who, stretching out their legs, prepared to
commence their recital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; cried the right foot, who appeared to be the
spokesman, clearing his throat and turning to his
companion&mdash;&lsquo;hem! which of our adventures shall I relate first,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied the left foot, after a few
moments&rsquo; reflection, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can do better
than tell our friend the story of Terence Duffy and the
heiress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Egad! you&rsquo;re right, brother; that was a droll
affair:&rsquo; and then, addressing himself to me, he continued,
&lsquo;You remember your Uncle Terence? A funny dog he was, and in his
young days the very devil for lovemaking and fighting. Look here,&rsquo;
said the speaker, pointing to a small circular perforation in his side,
which had been neatly patched. &lsquo;This mark, which I shall carry with
me to my grave, I received in an affair between your uncle and Captain
Donovan of the North Cork Militia. The captain one day asserted in the
public library at Ballybreesthawn, that a certain Miss Biddy
O&rsquo;Brannigan had hair red as a carrot. This calumny was not long in
reaching the ears of your Uncle Terence, who prided himself on being the
champion of the <em>sex</em> in general, and of Miss Biddy
O&rsquo;Brannigan in particular. Accordingly he took the earliest
opportunity of demanding from the captain an apology, and a confession
that the lady&rsquo;s locks were a beautiful auburn. The militia hero, who
was too courageous to desert his <em>colours</em>, maintained they were
red. The result was a meeting on the daisies at four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, when the captain&rsquo;s ball grazed your uncle&rsquo;s leg, and
in return he received a compliment from Terence, in the hip, that spoiled
his dancing for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will not insult your penetration by telling you what I
perceive you are already aware of, that Terence Duffy was the professed
admirer of Miss Biddy. The affair with Captain Donovan raised him
materially in her estimation, and it was whispered that the hand and
fortune of the heiress were destined for her successful champion.
There&rsquo;s an old saying, though, that the best dog don&rsquo;t always
catch the hare, as Terence found to his cost. He had a rival candidate for
the affections of Miss Biddy; but such a rival&mdash;however I will not
anticipate.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WIT WITHOUT MONEY;</h2>
<h3>OR, HOW TO LIVE UPON NOTHING.</h3>
<h4>BY VAMPYRE HORSELEECH, ESQ.</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Creation&rsquo;s heir&mdash;the world, the world is
mine.&rdquo;&mdash;GOLDSMITH.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Philosophers, moralists, poets, in all ages, have never better pleased
themselves or satisfied their readers than when they have descanted upon,
deplored, and denounced the pernicious influence of money upon the heart
and the understanding. &ldquo;Filthy lucre&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;so much
trash as may be grasped thus&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;yellow mischief,&rdquo; I
know not, or choose not, to recount how many justly injurious names have
been applied to coin by those who knew, because they had felt, its
consequences. Wherefore, I say at once, it is better to have none
on&rsquo;t&mdash;to live without it. And yet, now I think better upon that
point, it is well not altogether to discourage its approach. On the
contrary, lay hold upon it, seize it, rescue it from hands which in all
probability would work ruin with it, and resolutely refuse, when it is
once got, to let it go out of your grasp. Let no absurd talk about
quittance, discharge, remuneration, payment, induce the holder to relax
from his inflexible purpose of palm. Pay, like party, is the madness of
many for the gain of a few.</p>
<p>Unhappily, vile gold, or its representation or equivalent, has been,
during many centuries, the sole medium through which the majority of
mankind have supplied their wants, or ministered to their luxuries. It is
high time that a sage should arise to expound how the discerning
few&mdash;those who have the wit and the will (both must concur to the
great end) may live&mdash;LIVE&mdash;not like him who buys and balances
himself by the book of the groveller who wrote &ldquo;How to <em>Live</em>
upon Fifty Pounds a Year&rdquo;&mdash;(O shame to manhood!)&mdash;but
live, I say&mdash;&ldquo;be free and merry&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;laugh and
grow fat&rdquo;&mdash;exchange the courtesies of life&mdash;be a pattern
of the &ldquo;minor morals&rdquo;&mdash;and yet: all this without a doit
in bank, bureau, or breeches&rsquo; pocket.</p>
<p>I am that sage. Let none deride. Haply, I shall only remind some, but I
may teach many. Those that come to scoff, may perchance go home to
prey.</p>
<p>Let no gentleman of the old school (for whom, indeed, my brief treatise
is not designed) be startled when I advance this proposition: That more
discreditable methods are daily practised by those who live to get money,
than are resorted to by those who without money are nevertheless under the
necessity of living. If this proposition be assented to&mdash;as, in
truth, I know not how it can be gainsaid,&mdash;nothing need be urged in
vindication of my art of <em>free</em> living. Proceed I then at once.</p>
<p>Here is a youth of promise&mdash;born, like Jaffier, with
&ldquo;elegant desires&rdquo;&mdash;one who does not agnize a prompt
alacrity in carrying burdens&mdash;one, rather, who recognizes a moral and
physical unfitness for such, and indeed all other dorsal and manual
operations&mdash;one who has been born a Briton, and would not, therefore,
sell his birthright for a mess of pottage; but, on the contrary, holds
that his birthright entitles him to as many messes of pottage as there may
be days to his mortal span, though time&rsquo;s fingers stretched beyond
the distance allotted to extreme Parr or extremest Jenkins. &ldquo;Elegant
desires&rdquo; are gratified to the extent I purpose treating of them, by
handsome clothes&mdash;comfortable lodgings&mdash;good dinners.</p>
<p>1st. <em>Of Handsome Clothes.</em>&mdash;Here, I confess, I find myself
in some difficulty. The man who knows not how to have his name entered in
the day-book of a tailor, is not one who could derive any benefit from
instruction of mine. He must be a born natural. Why, it comes by
instinct.</p>
<p>2nd. <em>Of Comfortable Lodgings.</em>&mdash;Easily obtained and
secured. The easiest thing in life. But the wit without money must possess
very little more of the former than of the latter, if he do not, even when
snugly ensconced in one splendid suite of apartments, have his eye upon
many others; for landladies are sometimes vexatiously impertinent, and
novelty is desirable. Besides, his departure may be (nay, often is)
extremely sudden. When in quest of apartments, I have found tarnished
cards in the windows preferable. They imply a length of vacancy of the
floor, and a consequent relaxation of those narrow, worldly (some call
them prudent) scruples, which landladies are apt to nourish. Hints of a
regular income, payable four times a year, have their weight; nay, often
convert weekly into quarterly lodgings. Be sure there are no children in
your house. They are vociferous when you would enjoy domestic retirement,
and inquisitive when you take the air. Once (<em>horresco referens!</em>)
on returning from my peripatetics, I was accosted with brutally
open-mouthed clamour, by my landlady, who, dragging me in a state of
bewilderment into her room, pointed to numerous specimens of granite,
which her &ldquo;young people&rdquo; had, in their unhallowed thirst for
knowledge, discovered and drawn from my trunk, which, by some strange
mischance, had been left unlocked! In vain I mumbled something touching my
love of mineralogy, and that a lapidary had offered I knew not what for my
collection. I was compelled to &ldquo;bundle,&rdquo; as the idiomatic, but
ignorant woman expressed herself. To resume.</p>
<p>Let not the nervous or sensitive wit imagine that, in a vast metropolis
like London, his chance of securing an appropriate lodging and a confiding
landlady is at all doubtful. He might lodge safe from the past, certain of
the future, till the crash of doom. I shall be met by Ferguson&rsquo;s
case. Ferguson I knew well, and I respected him. But he had a most
unfortunate countenance. It was a very solemn, but by no means a solvent
face; and yet he had a manner with him too, and his language was choice,
if not persuasive. That the matter of his speech was plausible, none ever
presumed to deny. &ldquo;It is all very well, Mr.
Ferguson,&rdquo;&mdash;<em>that</em> was always conceded. I do not wish to
speak ill of the dead; but Ferguson never entered a lodging without being
compelled to pay a fortnight in advance, and always</p>

<p>EXPECTED TO BE OUT SHORTLY.</p>
</div>
<p>3rd. <em>Of Good Dinners.</em>&mdash;Wits, like other men, are
distinguished by a variety of tastes and inclinations. Some prefer dining
at taverns and eating-houses; others, more discreet or less daring, love
the quiet security of the private house, with its hospitable inmates,
courteous guests, and no possibility of &ldquo;bill transactions.&rdquo; I
confess when I was young and inexperienced, wanting that wisdom which I am
now happy to impart, I was a constant frequenter of taverns,
eating-houses, oyster-rooms, and similar places of entertainment. I am old
now, and have been persecuted by a brutal world, and am grown timid. But I
was ever a peaceable man&mdash;hated quarrels&mdash;never came to words if
I could help it. <em>I do not recommend the tavern, eating-house,
oyster-room system.</em> These are the words of wisdom. The waiters at
these places are invariably sturdy, fleet, abusive rascals, who cannot
speak and will not listen to reason. To eat one&rsquo;s dinner, drink a
pint of sherry, and then, calling for the bill, take out one&rsquo;s
pocket-book, and post it in its rotation in a neat hand, informing the
waiter the while, that it is a simple debt, and so forth; this really
requires nerve. Great spirits only are equal to it. It is an innovation
upon old, established forms, however absurd&mdash;and innovators bring
down upon themselves much obloquy. To run from the score you have run
up&mdash;not to pay your shot, but to shoot from payment&mdash;this is not
always safe, and invariably spoils digestion. No; it is not more
honourable&mdash;far from it&mdash;but it is better; for you should strive
to become, what is commonly called&mdash;&ldquo;A Diner
Out&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, one who continues to sit at the private
tables of other men every day of his life, and by his so potent art,
succeeds in making them believe that they are very much obliged to
him.</p>
<p>How to be this thing&mdash;this &ldquo;Diner Out&rdquo;&mdash;I shall
teach you, by a few short rules next week. Till then&mdash;farewell!</p>

<h2>LITERARY RECIPES.</h2>
<p>The following invaluable literary recipes have been most kindly
forwarded by the celebrated Ude. They are the produce of many years&rsquo;
intense study, and, we must say, the very best things of the sort we have
ever met with. There is much delicacy in M. Ude leaving it to us, as to
whether the communication should be anonymous. We think not, as the
peculiarity of the style would at once establish the talented authorship,
and, therefore, attempted concealment would be considered as the result of
a too morbidly modest feeling.</p>
<h3>HOW TO COOK UP A FASHIONABLE NOVEL.</h3>
<p>Take a consummate puppy&mdash;M.P.s preferable (as they are generally
the softest, and don&rsquo;t require much pressing)&mdash;baste with
self-conceit&mdash;stuff with slang&mdash;season with maudlin
sentiment&mdash;hash up with a popular publisher&mdash;simmer down with
preparatory advertisements. Add six reams of gilt-edged paper&mdash;grate
in a thousand quills&mdash;garnish with marble covers, and morocco backs
and corners. Stir up with magazine puffs&mdash;skim off sufficient for
preface. Shred scraps of French and small-talk, very fine. Add
&ldquo;superfine coats&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;satin
stocks&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bouquets&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;opera-boxes&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a
duel&rdquo;&mdash;an elopement&mdash;St. George&rsquo;s
Church&mdash;silver bride favours&mdash;eight footmen&mdash;four
postilions&mdash;the like number of horses&mdash;a &ldquo;dredger&rdquo;
of smiles&mdash;some filtered tears&mdash;half-mourning for a dead uncle
(the better if he has a twitch in his nose), and serve with anything that
will bear &ldquo;<em>frittering</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A SENTIMENTAL DITTO.</h3>
<h4>(<em>By the same Author.</em>)</h4>
<p>Take a young lady&mdash;dress her in blue ribbons&mdash;sprinkle with
innocence, spring flowers, and primroses. Procure a Baronet (a Lord if in
season); if not, a depraved &ldquo;younger son&rdquo;&mdash;trim him with
&eacute;cart&eacute;, rouge et noir, Epsom, Derby, and a slice of
Crockford&rsquo;s. Work up with rustic cottage, an aged father, blind
mother, and little brothers and sisters in brown holland pinafores.
Introduce mock abduction&mdash;strong dose of virtue and repentance. Serve
up with village church&mdash;happy parent&mdash;delighted
daughter&mdash;reformed rake&mdash;blissful brothers&mdash;syren
sisters&mdash;and perfect <em>d&eacute;nouement</em>.</p>
<p>N.B. Season with perspective christening and postponed epitaph.</p>
<h3>A STARTLING ROMANCE.</h3>
<p>Take a small boy, charity, factory, carpenter&rsquo;s apprentice, or
otherwise, as occasion may serve&mdash;stew him well down in
vice&mdash;garnish largely with oaths and flash songs&mdash;boil him in a
cauldron of crime and improbabilities. Season equally with good and bad
qualities&mdash;infuse petty larceny, affection, benevolence, and
burglary, honour and housebreaking, amiability and arson&mdash;boil all
gently. Stew down a mad mother&mdash;a gang of robbers&mdash;several
pistols&mdash;a bloody knife. Serve up with a couple of murders&mdash;and
season with a hanging-match.</p>
<p>N.B. Alter the ingredients to a beadle and a workhouse&mdash;the scenes
may be the same, but the whole flavour of vice will be lost, and the boy
will turn out a perfect pattern.&mdash;Strongly recommended for weak
stomachs.</p>
<h3>AN HISTORICAL DITTO.</h3>
<p>Take a young man six feet high&mdash;mix up with a horse&mdash;draw a
squire from his father&rsquo;s estate (the broad-shouldered and loquacious
are the best sort)&mdash;prepare both for potting (that is, exporting).
When abroad, introduce a well-pounded Saracen&mdash;a foreign
princess&mdash;stew down a couple of dwarfs and a conquered
giant&mdash;fill two sauce-tureens with a prodigious ransom. Garnish with
garlands and dead Turks. Serve up with a royal marriage and cloth of
gold.</p>
<h3>A NARRATIVE.</h3>
<p>Take a distant village&mdash;follow with high-road&mdash;introduce and
boil down pedlar, gut his pack, and cut his throat&mdash;hang him up by
the heels&mdash;when enough, let his brother cut him down&mdash;get both
into a stew&mdash;pepper the real murderer&mdash;grill the innocent for a
short time&mdash;then take them off, and put delinquents in their place
(these can scarcely be broiled too much, and a strong fire is particularly
recommended). When real perpetrators are <em>done</em>, all is
complete.</p>
<p>If the parties have been poor, serve up with mint sauce, and the name
of the enriched sufferer.</p>
<h3>BIOGRAPHY OF KINGS.</h3>
<p>Lay in a large stock of &ldquo;gammon&rdquo; and
pennyroyal&mdash;carefully strip and pare all the tainted parts away, when
this can be done without destroying the whole&mdash;wrap it up in printed
paper, containing all possible virtues&mdash;baste with flattery, stuff
with adulation, garnish with fictitious attributes, and a strong infusion
of sycophancy.</p>
<p>Serve up to prepared courtiers, who have been previously well seasoned
with long-received pensions or sinecures.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h2>DRAMATIC RECIPES.</h2>
<h3>FOR THE ADELPHI.&mdash;VERY FINE!</h3>
<p>Take a beautiful and highly-accomplished young female, imbued with
every virtue, but slightly addicted to bigamy! Let her stew through the
first act as the bride of a condemned convict&mdash;then season with a
benevolent but very ignorant lover&mdash;add a marriage. Stir up with a
gentleman in dusty boots and large whiskers. <em>Dredge</em> in a meeting,
and baste with the knowledge of the dusty boot proprietor being her
husband. Let this steam for some time; during which, prepare, as a
covering, a pair of pistols&mdash;carefully insert the bullet in the head
of him of the dusty boots. Dessert&mdash;general offering of LADIES&rsquo;
FINGERS! Serve up with red fire and tableaux.</p>
<h3>FOR MESSRS. MACREADY AND CHARLES KEAN.</h3>
<p>Take an enormous hero&mdash;work him up with
improbabilities&mdash;dress him in spangles and a long
train&mdash;disguise his head as much as possible, as the great beauty of
this dish is to avoid any resemblance to the &ldquo;<em>t&ecirc;te de veau
au naturel</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>OUR CITY ARTICLE.</h3>
<p>We have no arrivals to-day, but are looking out anxiously for the
overland mail from Battersea. It is expected that news will be brought of
the state of the mushroom market, and great inconvenience in the mean time
is felt by the dealers, who are holding all they have got, in the
anticipation of a fall; while commodities are, of course, every moment
getting heavier.</p>
<p>The London and Westminster steam-boat <em>Tulip</em>, with letters from
Milbank, was planted in the mud off Westminster for several hours, and
those who looked for the correspondence, had to look much longer than
could have been agreeable.</p>
<p>The egg market has been in a very unsettled state all the week; and we
have heard whispers of a large breakage in one of the wholesale houses.
This is caused by the dead weight of the packing-cases, to which every
house in the trade is liable. In the fruit market, there is positively
nothing doing; and the <em>growers</em>, who are every day becoming
<em>less</em>, complain bitterly. Raspberries were very slack, at
2&frac12;d. per pottle; but dry goods still brought their prices. We have
heard of several severe smashes in currants, and the bakers, who, it is
said, generally contrive to get a finger in the pie, are among the
sufferers.</p>
<p>The salmon trade is, for the most part, in a pickle; but we should
regret to say anything that might be misinterpreted. The periwinkle and
wilk interest has sustained a severe shock; but potatoes continue to be
<em>done</em> much as usual.</p>

<h3>JOHN BULL <em>v.</em> THE PEEL PLACE-HUNTING COMPANY.</h3>
<p>MR. JOBTICKLER said he had to move in this cause for an injunction to
restrain the Peel Place-hunting Company from entering into possession of
the estates of plaintiff. It appeared from the affidavits on which he
moved, that the defendants, though not in actual possession, laid an
equitable claim to the fee simple of the large estates rightfully
belonging to the plaintiff, over which they were about to exercise
sovereign dominion. They had entered into private treaty with the blind
old man who held the post of chief law-grubber of the Exchequer, offering
him a bribe to pretend illness, and take half his present pay, in order to
fasten one of the young and long-lived leeches&mdash;one Sir Frederick
Smal-luck&mdash;to the vacant bench. They were about to compel a decentish
sort of man, who did the business of Chancery as well as such business can
be done under the present system, to retire upon half allowance, in order
to make room for one Sir William Fullhat, who had no objection to
&pound;14,000 a year and a peerage. They were about to fill two
sub-chancellorships, which they would not on any account allow the company
in the present actual possession of the estates to fill up with a couple
of their own shareholders; and were, in fine, proceeding to dispose of, by
open sale, and by private contract, the freehold, leasehold, and funded
property of plaintiff, to the incalculable danger of the estate, and to
the disregard of decency and justice. What rendered this assumption and
exercise of power the more intolerable, was, that the persons the most
unfit were selected; and as if, it would appear, from a &ldquo;hateful
love of contraries,&rdquo; the man learned in law being sent to preside
over the business of equity, of which he knew nothing, and the man learned
in equity being entrusted with the direction of law of which he knew worse
than nothing; being obliged to unlearn all he had previously learnt,
before he began to learn his new craft.</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you know, sir, that <em>poeta
nascitur non fit?</em> Is not a judge a judge the moment he applies
himself to the seat of justice?</p>
<p>MR. JOBTICKLER.&mdash;Most undoubtedly it is so, my lord, as your
lordship is a glorious example, but&mdash;</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;But me no buts, sir. I&rsquo;ll have no
allusions made to my person. What way are the cases on the point you would
press on the court?</p>
<p>MR. JOBTICKLER.&mdash;The cases, I am sorry to say, are all in favour
of the Peel Place-hunting Company&rsquo;s proceedings; but the principle,
my lord, the principle!</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;Principle! What has principle to do with
law, Sir? Really the bar is losing all reverence for authority, all regard
for consistency. I must put a stop to such revolutionary tendencies on the
part of gentlemen who practise in my court. Sit down, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JOBTICKLER.&mdash;May my client have the injunction?</p>
<p>LORD HIGH INQUISITOR.&mdash;No-o-o-o! But he shall pay all the costs,
and I only wish I could double them for his impertinence. You, sir, you
deserve to be stripped of your gown for insulting the ears of the court
with such a motion.</p>

<h4>FROM EBENEZER BEWLEY, OF LONDON, TO HIS FRIEND REUBEN PIM, OF
LIVERPOOL.</h4>
<p style="text-align:right;">7th mo. 29th, 1841.</p>
<p>Friend Reuben,&mdash;I am in rect. of thine of 27th inst., and note
contents. It affordeth me consolation that the brig <em>Hazard</em> hath
arrived safely in thy port&mdash;whereof I myself was an
underwriter&mdash;also, that a man-child hath been born unto thee and to
thy faithful spouse Rebecca. Nevertheless, the house of Crash and Crackitt
hath stopped payment, which hath caused sore lamentation amongst the
faithful, who have discounted their paper. It hath pleased Providence to
raise the price of E.I. sugars; the quotations of B.P. coffee are likewise
improving, in both of which articles I am a large holder. Yet am I not
puffed up with foolish vanity, but have girded myself round with the
girdle of lowliness, even as with the band which is all round my hat! In
token whereof, I offered to hand 20 puncheons of the former, as <img src=

<p>There are serious ferments and heartburnings amongst the great ones of
this land: and those that sit on the benches called &ldquo;The
Treasury&rdquo; are become sore afraid, for he whom men call Lord John
Russell hath had notice to quit. Thereat, the Tories rejoice mightily, and
lick their chops for the fat morsels and the sops in the pan that Robert
the son of <em>Jenny</em> hath promised unto his followers. Nevertheless,
tidings have reached me that a good spec. might be made in Y.C. tallow,
whereon I desire thy opinion; as also on the practice of stuffing roast
turkey with green walnuts, which hath been highly recommended by certain
of the brethren here, who have with long diligence and great anxiety
meditated upon the subject.</p>
<p>And now, I counsel thee, hold fast the change which thou hast, striving
earnestly for that which thou hast not, taking heed especially that no man
comes the &ldquo;artful&rdquo; over thee; whereby I caution thee against
one Tom Kitefly of Manchester, whose bills have returned back unto me,
clothed with that unseemly garment which the notary calleth &ldquo;a
protest.&rdquo; Assuredly he is a viper in the paths of the unwary, and
will bewray thee with his fair speeches; therefore, I say, take heed unto
him.</p>

<h3>TO BAD JOKERS.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;Seeing in the first number of your paper an announcement
from Mr. Thomas Hood, that he was in want of a laugher, I beg to offer my
services in that comic capacity, and to hand you my card and certificates
of my cachinnatory powers.</p>
<p>T.C.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>CARD.</h4>
<p>Mr. Toady Chuckle begs to inform wits, punsters, and jokers in general
that he</p>
<h5>GOES OUT LAUGHING.</h5>
<p>His truly invaluable zest for bad jokes has been patronised by several
popular farce-writers and parliamentary Pasquins.</p>
<p>Mr. T.C. always has at command smiles for satire, simpers for repartee,
sniggers for conundrums, titters for puns, and guffaws for jocular
anecdotes. By Mr. T.C.&rsquo;s system, cues for laughter are rendered
unnecessary, as, from a long course of practical experience, the moment of
cachinnation is always judiciously selected.</p>
<p>N.B. The worst Jokes laughed at, and rendered successful. Old Joes made
to tell as well as new.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h5>COMIC CREDENTIALS.</h5>
<p>T.R.C.G.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I feel myself bound in justice to you and your invaluable
laughter, as well as to others who may be suffering, as I have been, with
a weakly farce, to inform you of its extraordinary results in my case. My
bantling was given up by all the faculty, when you were happily shown into
the boxes. One laugh removed all sibillatory indications; a second
application of your invaluable cachinnation elicited slight applause;
whilst a third, in the form of a <em>guffaw</em>, rendered it perfectly
successful.</p>
<p>From the prevalence of dulness among dramatic writers, I have no doubt
that your services will be in general requisition.</p>
<p>I am, yours, very respectfully,<br />
J.R. Planche.<br />
C&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I beg to inform you, for the good of other bad jokers, that
I deem the introduction of your truly valuable cachinnation one of the
most important ever made; in proof of which, allow me to state, that after
a joke of mine had proved a failure for weeks, I was induced to try your
cachinnation, by the use of which it met with unequivocal success; and, I
declare, if the cost were five guineas a <em>guffaw</em>, I would not be
without it.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br />
Charles Delaet Waldo Sibthorp (Colonel).</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S INFORMATION FOR THE PEOPLE.&mdash;NO. 1.</h2>
<h3>BEING A VERY FAMILIAR TREATISE ON ASTRONOMY.</h3>
<p>Our opinion is, that science cannot be too familiarly dealt with; and
though too much familiarity certainly breeds contempt, we are only
following the fashion of the day, in rendering science somewhat
contemptible, by the strange liberties that publishers of <em>Penny
Cyclop&aelig;dias</em>, three-halfpenny <em>Informations</em>, and
twopenny <em>Stores of Knowledge</em>, are prone to take with it.</p>
<p>In order to show that we intend going at high game, we shall begin with
the stars; and if we do not succeed in levelling the heavens to the very
meanest capacity&mdash;even to that of</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/004-05.png"><img src=
"images/004-05.png" alt="A squalling child punches its mother." id=
"img004-05" name="img004-05" width="50%" /></a>
<p>AN INFANT IN ARMS&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>we shall at once give up all claims to the title of an enlightener of
the people.</p>
<p>Every body knows there are planets in the air, which are called the
<em>planetary</em> system. Every one knows our globe goes upon its axis,
and has two poles, but what is the axis, and what the poles are made
of&mdash;whether of wood, or any other material&mdash;are matters which,
as far as the mass are concerned, are involved in the greatest possible
obscurity.</p>
<p>The north pole is chiefly remarkable for no one having ever succeeded
in reaching it, though there seems to have been a regular communication to
it by post in the time of Pope, whose lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Speed the soft intercourse from zone to zone.</p>
<p>And waft a sigh from Indus <em>to the pole</em>,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>imply, without doubt, that packages reached the pole; not, however,
without regard to the <em>size</em> (SIGHS), which may have been
limited.</p>
<p>The sun, every body knows, is very large, and indeed the size has been
ascertained to an inch, though we must say we should like to see the
gentleman who measured it. Astronomers declare there are spots upon it,
which may be the case, unless the <em>savans</em> have been misled by
specks of dirt on the bottom of their telescopes. As these spots are said
to disappear from time to time, we are strongly inclined to think our idea
is the correct one. Some insist that the sun is liquid like water, but if
it were, the probability is, that from its intense heat, the whole must
have boiled away long ago, or put itself out, which is rather more
feasible.</p>
<p>We do not think it necessary to go into the planets, for, if we did, it
is not unlikely we should be some time time before we got out again; but
we shall say a few words about our own Earth, in which our readers must,
of course, take a special interest.</p>
<p>It has been decided, that, viewed from the moon, our globe presents a
mottled appearance; but, as this assertion can possibly rest on no better
authority than that of the Man in the Moon, we must decline putting the
smallest faith in it.</p>
<p>It is calculated that a day in the moon lasts just a fortnight, and
that the night is of the same duration. If this be the case, the watchmen
in the moon must be horridly over-worked, and daily labourers must be
fatigued in proportion. When the moon is on the increase, it is seen in
the crescent; but whether Mornington-crescent or Burton-crescent, or any
other crescent in particular, has not been mentioned by either ancient or
modern astronomers. The only articles we get from the moon, are moonlight
and madness. <em>Lunar</em> caustic is not derived from the planet alluded
to.</p>
<p>Of the stars, one of the most brilliant is <em>Sirius</em>, or <em>the
Dog-star</em>, which it is calculated gives just one-twenty-millionth part
of the light of the sun, or about as much as that of a farthing rushlight.
It would seem that such a shabby degree of brilliancy was hardly worth
having; but when it is remembered that it takes three years to come, it
really seems hardly worth while to travel so far to so very little
purpose.</p>
<p>The most magnificent of the starry phenomena, is the Milky Way or
<em>Whey</em>; and, indeed, the epithet seems superfluous, for all
<em>whey</em> is to a certain extent milky. The <em>Band of Orion</em> is
familiar to all of us by name; but it is not a musical band, as most
people are inclined to think it is. Perhaps the allusion to the <em>music
of the spheres</em> may have led to this popular error, as well as to that
which regards Orion&rsquo;s <em>band</em> as one of <em>wind</em>
instruments.</p>
<p>We shall not go into those ingenious calculations that some astronomers
have indulged in, as to the time it would take for a cannon-ball to come
from the sun to the earth, for we really hope the earth will never be
troubled by so unwelcome a visitor. Nor shall we throw out any suggestions
as to how long a bullet would be going from the globe to the moon; for we
do not think any one would be found goose enough to take up his rifle with
the intention of trying the experiment.</p>
<p>Comets are, at present, though very luminous bodies, involved in
considerable obscurity. Though there is plenty of light in comets, we are
almost entirely in the dark concerning them. All we know about them is,
that they are often coming, but never come, and that, after frightening us
every now and then, by threatening destruction to our earth, they turn
sharp off, all of a sudden, and we see no more of them. Astronomers have
spied at them, learned committees have sat upon them, and old women have
been frightened out of their wits by them; but, notwithstanding all this,
the <em>comet</em> is so utterly mysterious, that &ldquo;thereby <em>hangs
a tail</em>&rdquo; is all we are prepared to say respecting it.</p>
<p>We trust the above remarks will have thrown a light on the sun and
moon, illustrated the stars, and furnished a key to the skies in general;
but those who require further information are referred to Messrs. Adams
and Walker, whose plans of the universe, consisting of several yellow
spots on a few yards of black calico, are exactly the things to give the
students of astronomy a full development of those ideas which it has been
our aim to open out to him.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</h2>
<p>We beg to invite attention to the aspect of our Foreign Affairs. It is
dark, lowering, gloomy&mdash;some would say, alarming. When it smiles, its
smiles deceive. To use the very mildest term, it is exceedingly
suspicious. Let John Bull look to his pockets.</p>
<p>It is, nevertheless, but a piece of justice to state, that, formidable
as the appearance of Foreign Affairs may be, no blame whatever can, in our
opinion, be attached to Lord Palmerston.</p>
<p>The truth is, that the Foreign Affairs of PUNCH are not the Foreign
Affairs of Politics. They are certain living beings; and we call them
Affairs, by way of compromise with some naturalists, to whom the
respective claims of man and the ape to their relationship may appear as
yet undecided.</p>
<p>In their anatomical construction they undoubtedly resemble mankind;
they are also endowed with the faculty of speech. Their clothes, moreover,
do not grow upon their backs, although they look very much as if they did.
They come over here in large numbers from other countries, chiefly from
France; and in London abound in Leicester-square, and are constantly to be
met with under the Quadrant in Regent-street, where they grin, gabble,
chatter, and sometimes dance, to the no small diversion of the
passengers.</p>
<p>As these Foreign Affairs have long been the leaders of fashion, and
continue still to give the tone to the manners and sentiments of the
politer circles, where also their language is, perhaps, more frequently
spoken than the vernacular tongue; and as there is something about
them&mdash;no matter what&mdash;which renders them great favourites with a
portion of the softer sex, we shall endeavour to point out, for the
edification of those who may be disposed to copy them, those peculiarities
of person, deportment, and dress, by which their tribe is
distinguished.</p>
<p>We address ourselves more particularly to those whose animal
part&mdash;every man is said to resemble, in some respect, one of the
lower animals&mdash;is made up of the marmozet and the puppy.</p>
<p>Be it known, then, to all those whom it may concern, that there are, to
speak in a general way, two great classes of Foreign Affairs&mdash;the
shining and the dingy.</p>
<p>The characteristic appearance of the former might, perhaps, be obtained
by treating the apparel with a preparation of plumbago or black lead; that
of the latter by the use of some fuliginous substance, as a dye, or,
perhaps, by direct fumigation. The gloss upon the cheeks might be produced
by perseverance in the process of dry-rubbing; the more humid style of
visage, by the application of emollient cataplasms. General sallowness
would result, as a matter of course, from assiduous dissipation. Young
gentlemen thus glazed and varnished, <em>French</em>-polished, in fact,
from top to toe, might glitter in the sun like beetles; or adopt, if they
preferred it, as being better adapted for lady-catching, the more sombre
guise of the spider.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs have two opposite modes of wearing the hair; we can
recommend both to those studious of elegance. The locks may be suffered to
flow about the shoulders in ringlets, resembling the tendrils of the vine,
by which means much will be done towards softening down the asperities of
sex; or they may be cropped close to the scalp in such a manner as to
impart a becoming prominence to the ears. When the development of those
appendages is more than usually ample, and when nature has given the head
a particularly stiff and erect covering, descending in two lateral
semicircles, and a central point on the forehead, the last mentioned style
is the more appropriate By its adoption, the most will be made of certain
personal, we might almost say generic, advantages;&mdash;we shall call it,
in the language of the Foreign Affairs themselves, the <em>coiffure
&agrave;-la-singe</em>.</p>
<p>Useful hints, with respect to the management of the whiskers, may be
derived from the study of Foreign Affairs. The broad, shorn, smooth extent
of jaw, darkened merely on its denuded surface, and the trimmed regular
fringe surrounding the face, are both, in perhaps equal degrees, worthy of
the attention of the tasteful. The shaggy beard and mustachios,
especially, if aided by the effect of a ferocious scowl, will admirably
suit those who would wish to have an imposing appearance; the chin, with
its pointed tuft <em>&agrave; la capricorne</em>, will, at all events,
ensure distinction from the human herd; and the decorated upper lip, with
its downy growth dyed black, and gummed (the cheek at the same time having
been faintly tinged with rouge, the locks parted, perfumed, and curled,
the waist duly compressed, a slight addition, if necessary, made to the
breadth of the hips, and the feet confined by the most taper and
diminutive <em>chausserie</em> imaginable), will just serve to give to the
<em>tout ensemble</em> that one touch of the masculine character which,
perhaps, it may be well to retain.</p>
<p>The remarkable tightness and plumpness of limbs and person exhibited by
Foreign Affairs cannot have escaped observation. This attractive quality
may be acquired by purchasing the material out of which the clothes are to
be made, and giving the tailor only just as much as may exactly suffice
for the purpose. Its general effect will be much aided by wearing
wristbands turned up over the cuff, and collars turned down upon the
stock. An agreeable contrast of black and white will thus also be
produced. Those who are fonder of harmony will do well to emulate the
closely-buttoned sables likewise worn by a large class of Foreign Affairs,
who, affecting a uniform tint, eschew the ostentation of linen.</p>
<p>The diminution of the width of their coat collars, and the increase of
the convexity of their coat tails, an object which, by artificial
assistance, might easily be gained, are measures which we would earnestly
press on all who are ambitious of displaying an especial resemblance to
Foreign Affairs. We also advise them to have lofty, napless,
steeple-crowned hats.</p>
<p>He who would pass for a shining specimen, in every sense of the word,
of a Foreign Affair, should wear varnished boots, which, if composed
partly of striped cloth, or what is much prettier, of silk, will display
the ancles to the better advantage.</p>
<p>With regard to colours in the matter of costume, the contemplation of
Foreign Affairs will probably induce a preference for black, as being
better suited to the complexion, though it will, at the same time, teach
that the hues of the rainbow are capable, under certain circumstances, of
furnishing useful suggestions.</p>
<p>It will have been perceived that the Foreign Affairs of which we have
been treating are the Affairs of one particular nation: beside these,
however, there are others; but since all of their characteristics may be
acquired by letting the clothes alone, never interfering with the hair,
abstaining from the practice of ablution, and smoking German pipes about
the streets, they are hardly worth dwelling upon. Those who have light and
somewhat shaggy locks will study such models with the best success.</p>
<p>Not only the appearance, but the manners also, of Foreign Affairs, may
be copied with signal benefit. Two of their accomplishments will be found
eminently serviceable&mdash;the art of looking black, and that of leering.
These physiognomical attainments, exhibited by turns, have a marvellous
power of attracting female eyes&mdash;those of them, at least, that have a
tendency to wander abroad. The best way of becoming master of these
acquisitions is, to peruse with attention the features of bravoes and
brigands on the one hand, and those of opera-dancers on the other. The
progress of Foreign Affairs should be attentively watched, as the manner
of it is distinguished by a peculiar grace. This, perhaps, we cannot
better teach anyone to catch, than by telling him to endeavour, in
walking, to communicate, at each step, a lateral motion to his coat tail.
The gait of a popular actress, dressed as a young officer, affords, next
to that actually in question, the best exemplification of our meaning.
Habitual dancing before a looking-glass, by begetting a kind of second
nature, which will render the movements almost instinctive, will be of
great assistance in this particular.</p>
<p>In order to secure that general style and bearing for which Foreign
Affairs are so remarkable, the mind must be carefully divested of divers
incompatible qualities&mdash;such as self-respect, the sense of shame, the
reverential instinct, and that of conscience, as certain feelings are
termed. It must also be relieved of any inconvenient weight of knowledge
under which it may labour; though these directions are perhaps needless,
as those who have any inclination to form themselves after the pattern of
Foreign Affairs, are not very likely to have any such moral or
intellectual disqualifications to get rid of. However, it would only be
necessary to become conversant with the Affairs themselves, in order, if
requisite, to remove all difficulties of the sort. &ldquo;There is a
thing,&rdquo; reader, &ldquo;which thou hast often heard of, and it is
known to many in our land by the name of pitch;&rdquo; we need not finish
the quotation.</p>
<p>To defend the preceding observations from misconstruction, we will
make, in conclusion, one additional remark; Foreign <em>Affairs</em> are
one thing&mdash;Foreign <em>Gentlemen</em> another.</p>

<h2>THE MINTO-HOUSE MANIFESTO</h2>
<p>Some of our big mothers of the broad-sheet have expressed their
surprise that Lord John Russell should have penned so long an address to
the citizens of London, only the day before his wedding. For ourselves, we
think, it would have augured a far worse compliment to Lady John had he
written it the day after. These gentlemen very properly look upon marriage
as a most awful ceremony, and would, therefore, indirectly compliment the
nerve of a statesman who pens a political manifesto with the torch of
Hymen in his eyes, and the whole house odorous of wedding-cake. In the
like manner have we known the last signature of an unfortunate gentleman,
about to undergo a great public and private change, eulogized for the
firmness and clearness of its letters, with the perfect mastery of the
supplementary flourish. However, what is written is written; whether
penned to the rustling of bridesmaids&rsquo; satins, or the surplice of
the consolatory ordinary&mdash;whether to the anticipated music of a
marriage peal, or to the more solemn accompaniment of the bell of St.
Sepulchre&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Ha! Lord John, had you only spoken out a little year ago&mdash;had you
only told her Majesty&rsquo;s Commons what you told the Livery of
London&mdash;then, at this moment, you had been no moribund
minister&mdash;then had Sir Robert Peel been as far from St. James&rsquo;s
as he has ever been from Chatham. But so it is: the Whig Ministry, like
martyr Trappists, have died rather than open their mouths. They would not
hear the counsel of their friends, and they refused to <em>speak out</em>
to their enemies. They retire from office with, at least, this
distinction&mdash;they are henceforth honorary members of the Asylum for
the Deaf and Dumb!</p>
<p>Again, the Whigs are victims to their inherent sense of
politeness&mdash;to their instinctive observance of courtesy towards the
Tories. There has been no bold defiance&mdash;no challenge to mortal
combat for the cause of public good; but when Whig has called out Tory, it
has been in picked and holiday phrase&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;As if a brother should a brother dare,</p>
<p>To gentle exercise and proof of arms.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For a long time the people have expected to see &ldquo;cracked crowns
and bloody noses,&rdquo; and at length, with true John Bull disgust,
turned from the ring, convinced that the Whigs, whatever play they might
make, would never go in and fight.</p>
<p>But have the Tories been correspondingly courteous? By no means; the
generosity of politeness has been wholly with the Whigs. They, like
frolicsome youths at a carnival, have pelted their antagonists with
nothing harder than sugar-plums&mdash;with egg-shells filled with
rose-water; while the Tories have acknowledged such holiday missiles with
showers of brickbats, and eggs <em>not</em> filled with aromatic dew. What
was the result? The Tories increased in confidence and strength with every
new assault; whilst the battered Whigs, from their sheer pusillanimity,
became noisome in the nostrils of the country.</p>
<p>At length, the loaves and fishes being about to be carried off, the
Whigs speak out: like sulky Master Johnny, who, pouting all dinner-time,
with his finger in his mouth, suddenly finds his tongue when the
apple-dumplings are to be taken from the table. Then does he advance his
plate, seize his ivory knife and fork, put on a look of determined
animation, and cry aloud for plenty of paste, plenty of fruit, and plenty
of sugar! And then <em>Mrs. Tory</em> (it must be confessed a wicked old
<em>Mother Cole</em> in her time), with a face not unlike the countenance
of a certain venerable paramour at a baptismal rite, declares upon her
hopes of immortality that the child shall have nothing of the sort, there
being nothing so dangerous to the constitution as plenty of flour, plenty
of fruit, and plenty of sugar. Therefore, there is a great uproar with
Master Johnny: the House, to use a familiar phrase, is turned out of the
windows; the neighbourhood is roused; Master Johnny rallies his friends
about him, that is, all the other boys of <em>the court</em>, and the
fight begins. Johnny and his mates make a very good fight, but certain
heavy Buckinghamshire countrymen&mdash;fellows of fifty stone&mdash;are
brought to the assistance of that screaming beldame <em>Mother Tory</em>,
and poor Master Johnny has no other election than to listen to the shouts
of triumph that declare there never shall be plenty of flour, plenty of
sugar, or, in a word, plenty of pudding.</p>
<p>However, Lord Russell is not discouraged. No; he says &ldquo;there
<em>shall</em> be cakes and ale, and ginger shall be hot i&rsquo; the
mouth, too!&rdquo; We only trust that his Lordship&rsquo;s manifesto is
not tinged by those feelings of hope (and in the case of his lordship we
may add, resignation) that animate most men about to enter wedlock. We
trust he does not confound his own anticipations of happiness with the
prospects of the country; for in allusion to the probable policy of the
Tories, he says&mdash;&ldquo;Returned to office&mdash;they may adopt our
measures, and submit to the influence of reason.&rdquo; Reason from the
Stanleys&mdash;reason from the Goulburns&mdash;reason from the Aberdeens!
When the Marquis of Londonderry shall have discovered the longitude, and
Colonel Sibthorp have found out the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, we may then
begin to expect the greater miracle.</p>
<p>The Whigs, according to Lord Russell&rsquo;s letter, have really done
so much when out of power, and&mdash;as he insinuates, are again ready to
do so much the instant they are expelled the Treasury&mdash;that for the
sake of the country, it must be a matter of lamentation if ever they get
in again.</p>

<h2>PUNCH AND SIR JOHN POLLEN.</h2>
<p>Punch, we regret to state, was taken into custody on Monday night at a
late hour, on a warrant, for the purpose of being bound over to keep the
peace towards Sir John Pollen, Bart. The circumstances giving rise to this
affair will be better explained by a perusal of the following
correspondence, which took place between ourselves and Sir John, on the
occasion, a copy of which we subjoin:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-top:2em;"><em>Wellington Street,
July</em> 30, 1841.</p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I have this moment read in the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>,
the correspondence between you and Lord William Paget, wherein you are
reported to say, that your recent defeat at the Andover election was
effected by &ldquo;tampering with some of the smaller voters, who would
have voted for <em>Punch or any other puppet</em>;&rdquo; and that such
expressions were not intended to be <em>personally offensive</em> to Lord
William Paget! The members of her Majesty&rsquo;s puppetry not permitting
derogatory conclusions to be drawn at their expense, I call upon you to
state whether the above assertions are correct; and if so, whether, in the
former case, you intended to allude personally to myself, or my friend
Colonel Sibthorp; or, in the latter, to infer that you considered Lord W.
Paget in any way our superior.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:0em;">I have the honour to be,
Sir, your obedient servant,<br />
PUNCH.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0em;">Sir John Pollen, Bart.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-top:2em;"><em>Redenham, July 30,
1841.</em></p>
<p>SIGNOR,&mdash;I have just received a note in which you complain of a
speech made by me at Andover. I have sent express for my Lord Wilkshire,
and will then endeavour to recollect what I did say.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:0em;">I have the honour to be,
your admirer,<br />
JOHN POLLEN.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0em;">To Signor Punch.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-top:2em;"><em>White Hart.</em></p>
<p>SIGNOR,&mdash;My friend Lord Wilkshire has just arrived. It is his
opinion that: I did use the terms &ldquo;Punch, or any other
puppet;&rdquo; but I intended them to have been highly complimentary, as
applied to Lord William Paget.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:0em;">I have the honour to be,
your increased admirer,<br />
JOHN POLLEN.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0em;">To Signor Punch.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-top:2em;"><em>Wellington
Street.</em></p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I and the Colonel are perfectly satisfied. Yours ever,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:0em;">PUNCH</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-top:2em;"><em>Wellington
Street.</em></p>
<p>MY LORD,&mdash;It would have afforded me satisfaction to have consulted
the wishes of Sir John Pollen in regard to the publication of this
correspondence. The over-zeal of Sir John&rsquo;s friends have left me no
choice in the matter, I shall print.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:0em;">Your obedient
servant,<br />
PUNCH.</p>

<p>A city friend met us the other morning: &ldquo;Hark &lsquo;ee,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;Alderman Humfery has been selling shares of the Blackwall
Railway, which were not in his possession; and when the directors
complained, and gave him notice that they would bring his conduct before a
full meeting, inviting him at the same time to attend, and vindicate or
explain his conduct as he best might, he not only declined to do so, but
hurried off to Dublin. Now, I want to know this,&rdquo; and he took me by
the button, &ldquo;why was Alderman Humfery, when he ran away to Dublin,
like the boy who ripped up his goose which laid golden
eggs?&rdquo;&mdash;We were fain to give it
up.&mdash;&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, with a cruel dig in the ribs,
&ldquo;because he <em>cut his lucky!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE BOY JONES&rsquo;S LOG.</h2>
<h3>PICKED UP AT SEA.</h3>
<p>The following interesting narrative of the sufferings of the youth
Jones, whose indefatigable pursuit of knowledge, under the most
discouraging circumstances, has been the cause of his banishment to a
distant shore, was lately picked up at sea, in a sealed bottle, by a
homeward-bound East Indiaman, and since placed in our hands by the captain
of the vessel; who complimented us by saying, he felt such confidence in
PUNCH&rsquo;S honour and honesty! (these were his very words), that he
unhesitatingly confided to him the precious document, in order that it
might be given to the world without alteration or curtailment.</p>
<p>We hasten to realise the captain&rsquo;s flattering estimate of our
character.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em>At see, on board the ship
Apollo.</em></p>
<p><em>June 30.</em>&mdash;So soon as the fust aggytation of my mind is
woar off, I take up my pen to put my scentiments on peaper, in hops that
my friends as nose the misfortin wich as oc-<em>curd</em> to me, may think
off me wen I&rsquo;m far a <em>whey</em>. Halass! sir, the wicktim of that
crewel blewbeard, Lord Melbun, who got affeard of my rising poplarity in
the Palass, and as sent me to <em>see</em> for my <em>peeping</em>,
though, heaven nose, I was acktyated by the pewrest motiffs in what I did.
The reel fax of the case is, I&rsquo;m a young man of an ighly cultiwated
mind and a very <em>ink</em>-wisitive disposition, wich naturally led me
to the use of the <em>pen</em>. I ad also bean in the abit of reading
&ldquo;Jak Sheppard,&rdquo; and I may add, that I O all my eleygant tastes
to the perowsal of that faxinating book. O! wot a noble mind the author of
these wollums must have!&mdash;what a frootful inwention and fine feelings
he displays!&mdash;what a delicat weal he throws over the piccadillys of
his ero, making petty larceny lovely, and burglarly butiful.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t mean now to enter into a reglar crickitism of
this egxtrornary work, but merely to observe, when I read it fust I felt a
thust for literrerry fame spring up in my buzzem; and I thort I should to
be an orthor. Unfortinnet delusion!&mdash;that thort has proved my rooin.
It was the <em>bean</em> of my life, and the destroyer of my
<em>pease</em>. From that moment I could think of nothink else; I
neglekted my wittles and my master, and wanderd about like a
knight-errand-boy who had forgotten his message. Sleap deserted my lowly
pillar, and, like a wachful shepherd, I lay all night awake amongst my
<em>flocks</em>. I had got hold of a single idear&mdash;it was the axle of
my mind, and, like a wheelbarrow, my head was always turning upon it. At
last I resolved to rite, and I cast my i&rsquo;s about for a
subject&mdash;they fell on the Palass! Ear, as my friend Litton Bulwer
ses, ear was a field for genus to sore into;&mdash;ear was an area for
fillophosy to dive into;&mdash;ear was a truly magnificient and
comprehensive desine for a great <em>nash</em>-ional picture! I had got a
splendid title, too&mdash;not for myself&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a sole above
such trumperry&mdash;but for my book. Boox is like humane beings&mdash;a
good title goes a grate way with the crowd:&mdash;the one I ad chose for
my <em>shed-oove</em>, was &ldquo;Pencillings in the Palass; or, a Small
Voice from the Royal Larder,&rdquo; with commick illustriations by Fiz or
Krokvill. Mr. Bentley wantid to be engaged as monthly nuss for my expected
projeny; and a nother gen&rsquo;leman, whose &ldquo;name&rdquo; shall be
&ldquo;never heard,&rdquo; offered to go <em>shears</em> with me, if
I&rsquo;d consent to <em>cut-uup</em> the Cort ladies. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
ses I, indignantly, &ldquo;I leave Cort scandle to my betters&mdash;I go
on independent principals into the Palass, and that&rsquo;s more than Lord
Melbun, or Sir Robert Peal, or any one of the insiders or outsiders ever
could or ever can say of theirselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I said <em>then</em>,&mdash;but now I think, what a
cussed fool I was. All my eye-flown bubbles were fated to be busted and
melted, like the <em>wigs</em>, &ldquo;into thin <em>hair</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Nong port!</em> We gets wiser as we gets</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Genteel Reader,&mdash;I beg your parding. I&rsquo;m better now. Bless
me, how the ship waggles! It&rsquo;s reelly hawful; the sailors only laff
at it, but I suppose as they&rsquo;re all <em>tars</em> they don&rsquo;t
mind being <em>pitched</em> a little.</p>
<p>The capting tells me we are now reglarly at see, having just passt the
North 4 land; so, ackording to custom, I begin my journal, or, as
naughtical men call it&mdash;to keep my log.</p>
<p><em>12 o&rsquo;clock.</em>&mdash;Wind.&mdash;All in my eye. Mate said
we had our larburd tax aboard&mdash;never herd of that tax on shore. Told
me I should learn to box the compass&mdash;tried, but couldn&rsquo;t do
it&mdash;so boxt the cabbing boy insted. Capting several times calld to a
man who was steering&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Port, port</em>;&rdquo; but though
he always anserd, &ldquo;Eye, eye, sir,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t bring him a
drop. The black cook fell into the hold on the topp of his hed. Everybody
sed he was gone to Davy Jones&rsquo;s locker; but he warn&rsquo;t, for he
soon came to again, drank 1/2 a pint of rumm, and declared it

<h3>THE ADVANTAGES OF ANIMAL MAGNETISM.</h3>
<p>The experiments of M. Delafontaine having again raised an outcry
against this noble science, from the apparent absence of any benefit
likely to arise from it, beyond converting human beings into pincushions
and galvanic dummies. We, who look deeper into things than the generality
of the world, hail it as an inestimable boon to mankind, and proceed at
once to answer the numerous enquirers as to the <em>cui bono</em> of this
novel soporific.</p>
<p>By a judicious application of the mesmeric fluid, the greatest domestic
comfort can be insured at the least possible trouble. The happiest
Benedict is too well aware that ladies will occasionally exercise their
tongues in a way not altogether compatible with marital ideas of quietude.
A few passes of the hand (&ldquo;in the way of kindness for he who
would,&rdquo; &amp;c. <em>vide</em> Tobin) will now silence the most
powerful oral battery; and Tacitus himself might, with the aid of
mesmerism, pitch his study in a milliner&rsquo;s work-room. Hen-pecked
husbands have now other means at their command, to secure quiet, than
their razors and their garters. We have experimentalised upon our Judy,
and find it answer to a miracle. Mrs. Johnson may shut up her laboratory
for American Soothing Syrup; mesmerism is the only panacea for those
morning and evening infantile ebullitions which affectionate mammas always
assign to the teeth, the wind, or a pain in the stomach, and never to that
possible cause, a pain in the temper. Mesmerism is &ldquo;the real
blessing to mothers,&rdquo; and Elliotson the Mrs. Johnson of the day. We
have tried it upon our Punchininny, and find it superior to our old
practice of throwing him out of the window.</p>
<p>Lovers, to you it is a boon sent by Cupid. Mammas, who will keep in the
room when your bosoms are bursting with adoration&mdash;fathers, who will
wake on the morning of an elopement, when the last trunk and the parrot
are confided to you from the window&mdash;bailiffs, who will hunt you up
and down their bailiwick, even to the church-door, though an heiress is
depending upon your character for weekly payments&mdash;all are rendered
powerless and unobtrusive by this inexplicable palmistry. Candidates, save
your money; mesmerise your opponents instead of bribing them, and you may
become a patriot by a show of hands.</p>
<p>These are a few of its social advantages&mdash;its political uses are
unbounded. Why not mesmerise the Chinese? and, as for the Chartists, call
out Delafontaine instead of the magistrates&mdash;a few mesmeric passes
would be an easy and efficient substitute for the &ldquo;Riot Act.&rdquo;
Then the powers of <em>clairvoyance</em>&mdash;the faculty of seeing with
their eyes shut&mdash;that it gives to the patient. Mrs. Ratsey, your
royal charge might be soothed and instructed at the same time, by
substituting a sheet of PUNCH for the purple and fine linen of her little
Royal Highness&rsquo;s nautilus-shell.</p>
<p>Lord John Russell, the policy of your wily adversary would no longer be
concealed. Jealous husbands, do you not see a haven of security, for brick
walls may be seen through, and letters read in the pocket of your rival,
by this magnetic telescope? whilst studious young gentleman may place
Homer under their arms, and study Greek without looking at it.</p>

<h3>FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>The Marquis of Waterford and party visited Vauxhall Gardens on Monday.
The turnpike man on the bridge was much <em>struck</em> by their easy
manner of dealing with their inferiors.</p>
<p>Alderman Magnay laid the first shell of an oyster grotto one night this
week in the Minories. There was a large party of boys, who, with the
worthy Alderman, repaired to a neighbouring fruit-stall, where the
festivity of the occasion was kept up for several minutes.</p>
<p>The New Cut was, as usual, a scene of much animation on Saturday last,
and there was rather a more brilliant display than customary of new and
elegant baked-potato stands. The well-known turn-out, with five lanterns
and four apertures for the steam, was the general admiration of the host
of pedestrians who throng the Cut between the hours of eight and twelve on
Saturday.</p>

<h3>A BITTER DRAUGHT.</h3>
<p>SIR R. PEEL, in the celebrated medicinal metaphor with which he lately
favoured his constituents at Tamworth, concludes by stating, &ldquo;that
he really believes he does more than any political physician ever did by
referring to the prescriptions which he offered in 1835 and 1840, and by
saying that he sees no reason to alter them.&rdquo; This is, to carry out
the physical figure, only another version of &ldquo;<em>the mixture as
before</em>.&rdquo; We are afraid there are no hopes of the patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are the Whigs like the toes of a
dancing-master?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Because they <em>must</em> be turned
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are Colonel Sibthorp and Mr. Peter Borthwick like the
covering of the dancing-master&rsquo;s toes?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Because
they are a <em>pair of pumps</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are the Whigs and Tories like the scarlet fever and the
measles?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s no telling which is the
worst.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A HINT TO THE UGLY.</h2>
<p>My uncle Septimus Snagglegrable is no more! Excellent old man! no one
knew his worthiness whilst he was of the living, for every one called him
a scoundrel.</p>
<p>It is reserved for me to do justice to his memory, and one short
sentence will be sufficient for the purpose&mdash;he has left me five
thousand pounds! I have determined that his benevolence shall not want an
imitator, and I have resolved, at a great personal sacrifice, to benefit
that portion of my fellow creatures who are denominated ugly. I am
particularly so. My complexion is a bright snuff-colour; my eyes are grey,
and unprotected by the usual verandahs of eye-lashes; my nose is
<em>retrouss&eacute;</em>, and if it has a bridge, it must be of the
suspension order, for it is decidedly concave. I wish Rennie would turn
his attention to the state of numerous noses in the metropolis. I am sure
a lucrative company might he established for the purpose of erecting
bridges to noses that, like my own, have been unprovided by nature. I
should be happy to become a director. <em>Revenons nous</em>&mdash;my
mouth is decidedly large, and my teeth singularly irregular. My father was
violently opposed to Dr. Jenner&rsquo;s &ldquo;repeal of the
small-pox,&rdquo;<sup>4</sup><span class="sidenote">4. Baylis.</span> and
would not have me vaccinated; the consequence of which has been that my
chin is full of little dells, thickly studded with dark and stunted
bristles. I have bunions and legs that (as &ldquo;the right line of
beauty&rsquo;s a curve&rdquo;) are the perfection of symmetry. My poor
mother used to lament what she, in the plenitude of her ignorance, was
pleased to denominate my disadvantages. She knew not the power of genius.
To me these&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll call them <em>defects</em>&mdash;have
been the source of great profit. For years I have walked about the great
metropolis without any known or even conjectural means of subsistence; my
coat has always been without a patch&mdash;my linen without spot!</p>
<p>Ugly brothers, I am about to impart to you the secret of my existence!
I have lived by the fine arts&mdash;yes, by sitting as</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A model for door-knockers and cherubim for tomb-stones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The latter may perhaps surprise you, but the contour of my countenance
is decidedly infantile&mdash;for when had a babby a bridge?&mdash;and the
addition of a penny trumpet completes the full-blown expression of the
light-headed things known to stone-masons as cherubim.</p>
<p>But it is to the art of knocker-designing that I flatter myself I have
been of most service. By the elevation of my chin, and the assistance of a
long wig, I can present an excellent resemblance of a lion, with this
great advantage over the real animal&mdash;I can vary the expression
according to circumstances&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;As mild as milk, or raging as the storm.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So that nervous single ladies need not be terrified out of their senses
every time they knock at their door, by the grim personification of a Nero
at feeding time; or a tender-hearted poor-law guardian be pestered during
dinner by invitations afforded to the starving poor by the benevolent
expression of his knocker.</p>
<p>Ugly ones! I have now imparted to you my secret.</p>

<h3>A CON. BY COLONEL SIBTHORP.</h3>
<p>Why is a chesnut horse, going at a rapid pace up an inclined plane,
like an individual in white trousers presenting a young lady in book
muslin with an infantine specimen of the canine species?&mdash;Because he
is giving <em>a gallop up</em> (a girl a pup).</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE DRAMA.</h3>
<h4>ASTLEY&rsquo;S COMPANY AT THE OLYMPIC.</h4>
<p>The distresses of actors distress nobody but themselves. A tale of woe
told off the stage by a broad comedian, begets little sympathy; and if he
is in the &ldquo;heavy line,&rdquo; people say he is used to it, and is
only acting&mdash;playing off upon you a melancholy joke, that he may
judge how it will <em>tell</em> at night. Thus, when misfortune takes a
benefit, charity seldom takes tickets; for she is always sceptical about
the so-called miseries of the most giddy, volatile, jolly, careless,
uncomplaining (where managers and bad parts are not concerned) vainest,
and apparently, happiest possible members of the community, who are so
completely associated with fiction, that they are hardly believed when
telling the truth. <em>Par exemple</em>&mdash;nothing can be more true
than that Astley&rsquo;s Theatre was burnt down the other day; that the
whole of that large establishment were suddenly thrown out of employ; that
their wardrobes were burnt to rags, their properties reduced to a cinder,
and their means of subsistence roasted in a too rapid fire. True also is
it, that to keep the wolf from their own doors, those of the Olympic have
been opened, where the really dismounted cavalry of Astley&rsquo;s are
continuing their campaign, having appealed to the public to support them.
Judging from the night we were present, that support has been extended
with a degree of lukewarmness which is exactly proportionate to the effect
produced by the appeals of actors when misfortune overtakes them.</p>
<p>But, besides public sympathy, they put forth other claims for support.
The amusements they offer are of extraordinary merit. The acting of Mr. H.
Widdicomb, of Miss Daly, and Mr. Sidney Forster, was, in the piece we
saw&mdash;&ldquo;The Old House at Home&rdquo;&mdash;full of nature and
quiet touches of feeling scarcely to be met with on any other stage. Still
these are qualifications the &ldquo;general&rdquo; do not always
appreciate; though they often draw tears, they seldom draw money. Very
well, to meet that deficiency, other and more popular actors have come
forward to offer their aid. Mr. T.P. Cooke has already done his part, as
he always does it, nobly. The same may be said of Mr. Hammond. When we
were present, Mrs. H.L. Grattan and Mr. Balls appeared in the &ldquo;Lady
of Munster.&rdquo; Mr. Sloan, a popular Irish comedian from the provinces,
has lent a helping hand, by coming out in a new drama. Mr. Keeley is also
announced.</p>
<p>The pieces we saw were well got up and carefully acted; so that the
patrons of the drama need not dread that, in this instance, the
Astleyan-Olympic actors believe that &ldquo;charity covers a multitude of
sins.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t care who sees their faults&mdash;the more
the better.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h4>&ldquo;BEHIND THE SCENES.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>When a certain class of persons, whose antipathy to gratis sea-voyages
is by no means remarkable, are overtaken by the police and misfortune;
when the last legal quibble has been raised upon their case and failed;
when, indeed, to use their own elegant phraseology, they are
&ldquo;regularly stumped and done up;&rdquo; then&mdash;and, to do them
justice, not till then&mdash;they resort to confession, and to turning
king&rsquo;s evidence against their accomplices.</p>
<p>This seems to be exactly the case with the drama, which is evidently in
the last stage of decline; the consumption of new subjects having
exhausted the supply. The French has been &ldquo;taken from&rdquo; till it
has nothing more to give; the Newgate Calendar no longer affords
materials; for an entire dramatic edition of it might be collected (a
valuable hint this for the Syncretic Society, that desperate association
for producing un-actable dramas)&mdash;the very air is exhausted in a
theatrical sense; for &ldquo;life in the clouds&rdquo; has been long voted
&ldquo;law;&rdquo; whilst the play-writing craft have already robbed the
regions below of every spark of poetic fire; devils are decidedly out of
date. In short, and not to mince the matter, as hyenas are said to stave
off starvation by eating their own haunches, so the drama <em>must</em> be
on its last legs, when actors turn king&rsquo;s evidence, and exhibit to
the public how they flirt and quarrel, and eat oysters and drink porter,
and scandalise and make fun&mdash;how, in fact, they disport themselves
&ldquo;Behind the Scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A visit to the English Opera will gratify those of the uninitiated, who
are anxious to get acquainted with the manners and customs of the ladies
and gentlemen of the <em>corps dramatique</em> &ldquo;at the wing.&rdquo;
Otherwise than as a sign of dramatic destitution, the piece called
&ldquo;Behind the Scenes&rdquo; is highly amusing. Mr. Wild&rsquo;s acting
displays that happy medium between jocularity and earnest, which is the
perfection of burlesque. Mrs. Selby plays the &ldquo;leading lady&rdquo;
without the smallest effort, and invites the first tragedian to her treat
of oysters and beer with considerable <em>empressement</em>, though
supposed to be labouring at the time <em>under</em> the stroke of the
headsman&rsquo;s axe. Lastly, it would be an act of injustice to Mr. Selby
to pass his <em>Spooney Negus</em> over in silence. PUNCH has too
brotherly an affection for his fellow-actors, to hide their faults; in the
hope that, by shewing them <em>veluti in speculum</em>, they may be
amended. In all kindness, therefore, he entreats Mr. Selby, if he be not
bent upon hastening his own ruin, if he have any regard for the feelings
of unoffending audiences, who always witness the degradation of human
nature with pain&mdash;he implores him to provide a substitute for
<em>Negus</em>. Every actor knows the difference between portraying
imbecility and <em>being</em> silly himself&mdash;between puerility, as
characteristic of a part <em>in posse</em>, and as being a trait of the
performer <em>in esse</em>. To this rule Mr. Selby, in this part, is a
melancholy exception; for he seems utterly ignorant of such a distinction,
broad as it is&mdash;he is silly himself, instead of causing silliness in
<em>Spooney</em>. This is the more to be regretted, as whoever witnessed,
with us, the first piece, saw in Mr. Selby a respectable representative of
an old dandy in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge.&rdquo; Moreover, the same gentleman
is, we understand, the adapter of the drama from Boz&rsquo;s tale. That
too proves him to be a clever contriver of situations, and an ingenious
adept with the pen and scissors.</p>
